	"724691": "But that was only possible because of your efforts.",
	"724693": "Don't be so modest. You guys said it too.",
	"724694": "He said I should confidently tell everyone about the world in my mind.",
	"724695": "When you're having fun, just laugh as hard as you can.",
	"724696": "I understand. I'll keep that in mind.",
	"724697": "Ohhhh, I must be getting somewhat old! I'm going to miss you if I talk any more.",
	"724698": "I look forward to seeing more of your plays in the future.",
	"724699": "Wherever you're doing it, I'll be the first to see it.",
	"724700": "It's a promise.",
	"724702": "Senpai, there's a place I'd like you to follow me before you leave.",
	"724703": "You're not up to something again, are you?",
	"724704": "You know, I might do something good once in a while too!",
	"724705": "You? If that happened, the sun would rise in the west.",
	"724706": "Chech~.",
	"724707": "I need you to keep the drama club together from now on. If you don't change your bad habits, the members will turn away from you.",
	"724708": "I've been good about that, and I'm fine with that.",
	"724709": "But I was very surprised that my seniors would refuse my request to become the next head of the department.",
	"724710": "I don't think I would be able to concentrate on honing my acting skills if I became a department head.",
	"724711": "Besides, I haven't caught up with you yet.",
	"724712": "Oops, perhaps a rivalry remark?",
	"724713": "How can you be so--",
	"724714": "The crest found something and ran to the front, even though it was in the middle of a conversation.",
	"724715": "Then we stopped at a back street. In the street was a small store.",
	"724716": "What's this store!",
	"724717": "You've always wanted one, haven't you?",
	"724718": "Maybe not exactly the same.",
	"724719": "How did you find this store?",
	"724720": "Don't underestimate my network. I told you, you don't need to worry about connections at all.",
	"724722": "Thank you.",
	"724723": "Let's go. Let's not miss it this time.",

	"724730": "\"...... please support our business!\"",
	"724731": "The traffic light turned green. The high pitched voices of the speeches were like fine bubbles, scattered by the waves of businessmen coming and going.",
	"724732": "The process was repetitive. The man reached out and shook the hand of someone passing in front of him and said.",
	"724733": "Hello. Please let me tell you my story--\"",
	"724734": "The man was still in the middle of his story, but his grip was shaken off.",
	"724735": "The person holding his hand looked at the man to see what was going on.",
	"724736": "Oh, ...... sorry about that.",
	"724737": "Oh.",
	"724738": "I am sorry to have to pull you out of the room so abruptly. However, for the sake of a bright and cheerful future for all mankind, each and every citizen has an obligation to take action. So I must tell you even if it is rude. ......",

	"724740": "...... eh?",
	"724741": "A woman in a suit pointed to a donation box held by a man.",

	"724743": "That .......",
	"724744": "When the man was taken aback, the woman placed a single bill in the donation box as if she were throwing it away.",
	"724745": "Change is fine.",
	"724746": "The woman began walking again, disappearing like a single bubble into the crowd and out of sight of the men.",
	"724747": "The woman's back was out of sight, and the man, who had been standing silently, finally voiced his anger a short time later.",
	"724748": "...... I am not begging!",
	"724750": "The sound of people's footsteps and happy conversations.",
	"724751": "The hum of the outdoor unit of an air conditioner, the sound of an automatic door, the cries of cicadas and children, the sound of a microwave oven in a convenience store.",
	"724752": "The sound of sighs, uncontrollable laughter, coughs, fans turning, car horns, engines, trees swaying in the wind.",
	"724753": "This is the sound of my hometown, Chang Ku City. These various sounds are played in a high and magnificent manner according to a single unified melody, and those who hear them are made to feel a greatness that cannot be described in words.",
	"724754": "Celebratory music blared from the colorfully painted balloons, leaflets fell and everything in every corner of this town trembled with joy, and the people felt a constant connection with their greatness and with themselves.",
	"724755": "Win, win, win.",
	"724756": "Jiriririn!",
	"724757": "Hello? Yes, we have already arrived at Changku City.",
	"724758": "This is a victory that could not have been achieved if you go back 10 billion years in the past. A victory for all mankind.",
	"724759": "Is it time? No, the airline tickets prepared by the organization are for arrival at this time, and we have not been able to find a hotel yet.",
	"724760": "The hard days are over, songs of victory are being sung, and people are drinking. We owe it all to the League of Human Contracts for leading us to victory.",
	"724761": "Yes......Yes......Yes......I am sorry for my lack of control.",
	"724762": "They celebrated the passing of affliction, they celebrated the absence of sorrow, they celebrated the absence of enemies, they celebrated the fact that the days gone by were past.",
	"724763": "It is all my fault. I will take the ticket immediately and return to New York.",
	"724764": "The woman ran at great speed, pressing the speaker of the phone to her ear, where she could hear her boss reprimanding her.",
	"724765": "Flyers advertising the victory of the League of Human Contracts were flying around like a confetti of roses at a triumphal entry ceremony. The woman turned back the way she came before the traffic light changed. Her figure was like a retrograde musical note.",
	"724766": "Before leaving Changkuo City, the woman opened the electronic document again and looked at the photo of the girl in it. Her face was somewhat relaxed as she looked at the photo.",
	"724767": "The girl in the photo had left Changkuu City about half a day earlier, and had crossed paths with a woman.",
	"724768": "--The name was written under the face in the photo: Houraiji Kyuushou.",
	"724769": "She shook her head and slid herself into another wave of people and disappeared.",

	"724776": "The lower part of my stomach squeezed, my skin tensed, and my body was ice cold.",
	"724777": "Death, sacrifice, farewell.",
	"724778": "It instantly slides down to the deepest place of memory.",
	"724779": "Kk......What the hell am I thinking......It's like I'm not myself.",
	"724780": "The Salvationist must not be disheartened by something of this magnitude.",
	"724781": "I immediately broke off the thought.",
	"724782": "Then I looked at myself in the mirror and smiled brightly.",
	"724783": "Phew. ....... I washed my face and it felt much better.",
	"724784": "--This must be water from the holy spring at the top of the cluster of stars! It must be a tribute to the Savior!",
	"724785": "Ding-dong.",
	"724786": "...... Who is this?",
	"724787": "With the water droplets still on his face, Kyuushou left the washroom, straddled the suitcase spread out on the floor, and walked to the front door.",
	"724788": "When I opened the door, there stood a woman in a suit.",
	"724789": "Hello. Are you ...... Houraiji Kyuushou?",
	"724790": "You can visit .......",
	"724791": "My name is Tesshi Issatsu, an entry-level agent of the Human Contracting Federation (Jinki-ren), in charge of the \"Together with Sunlight: Postwar Special Person Care Project\" of the Federation.",
	"724792": "When she said this, she showed Kyuushou the ID she wore on her chest. Kyuushou, however, had noticed the badge on her chest from the beginning.",
	"724793": "I will be in charge of the communication between Kyuushou and Jinki-ren for some time to come.",
	"724794": "Care project? ...... Oh, you mean that project my blood relative was talking about. They are going to pay for my college tuition or something like that.",
	"724795": "Yes, it is. The postwar allowance you get is at the highest level.",
	"724796": "So you were the one in charge of this project. I thought you were a salesman of some kind!",
	"724797": "--I'm not sure if this is the right place, so may I come in and talk to you?",
	"724798": "...... Hmm, good.",
	"724799": "Iron Master Issatsu nodded, bowed to Kyuushou, put the covers on his shoes, and entered the room.",
	"724800": "Once inside, she rotated the badge on her chest.",
	"724801": "What's that?",
	"724802": "This is a micro-body camera from Jinki-ren. This will be used to record the status of the conversation ahead.",
	"724803": "What, do we even have to do that?",
	"724804": "...... This is also a necessary procedure.",
	"724805": "Yes, yes. Then get started.",
	"724806": "Understood. Now, first of all, I would like you to answer the questions necessary to apply the \"Care Project\": ......Houraiji Kyuushou, why did you leave Changkuo City, where you live, yesterday to visit this New York City, where the headquarters of the Human Qi Federation is located?",
	"724807": "Especially at this sensitive time of the year ...... now.",
	"724808": "Sensitive period? Isn't that the kind of thing ...... we are free to do?",
	"724809": "That's because the ...... \"Care Project\" contract stipulates that each time you make a long trip, you must explain where you are going and why. It is specifically written in Chapter 3, Article 12, Section 2.",
	"724810": "Besides, the \"Rules on Penalties\" section of the contract also stipulates that if the contract is violated, a substantial allowance will be deducted based on the extent of the violation.",
	"724811": "Wait a minute! Let me see that. ...... Oh, it's true!",
	"724812": "But this contract is about 100 pages long, and no one will be able to remember all those details--I'm sure.",
	"724813": "But a contract is a contract, so we have no choice. Just like it's a job, so it can't be helped. ...... Well - now describe your itinerary for this trip.",
	"724814": "What, the rest of the story? Well, okay, ...... huh. There is no reason to come to a city where the headquarters of the Human Contractors Federation is located.",
	"724815": "College will be starting soon, and I just wanted to travel to make some good memories before I start attending college.",
	"724816": "Besides, Sirin and Estherine are here too. I thought I would come here and see my friends.",
	"724817": "How about this, this reason should suffice!",
	"724819": "When Tesshi Kazatsu looked down, the badge-shaped camera on his chest emitted a light blue light. After a moment, the light disappeared and returned to its original state.",
	"724820": "Thank you for your response. The reason now seems to be accepted.",
	"724821": "In any case, Houraiji Kyuushou, you may not go far for the next three days and act in the vicinity, but just be careful not to violate the other terms of the agreement.",
	"724822": "Also, in order to prevent any unnecessary misunderstandings or danger from arising from your activities in the future, for the next three days I will be dispatched by the Jinki-ren to protect your personal safety at all times.",
	"724823": "Perhaps you may think that an ordinary person like me cannot protect you, but please understand that this is written in our operations manual.",
	"724824": "What do you mean you want to protect ......? I mean, you just want to monitor them!",
	"724825": "I hope you will keep such things in mind.",
	"724827": "Yes, yes, okay, okay. Then protect me all you want. But \"protect me every second of the day.\" ...... Where are you going to live? This room is too small for you, don't you think?",
	"724828": "Don't worry. The League of Human Contracts is a modern, fully operational organization. We already have a room next door.",
	"724829": "When he said this, Tetsushi Issatsu bowed. However, the angle was not up to the standard angle.",
	"724830": "Then I am sorry, but I have to leave. I still have other things to do.",
	"724831": "For the next three days anyway ...... please let me know in advance if you plan any activities. I don't want to accidentally violate the contract and incur unnecessary losses.",
	"724832": "Please consider me as a shadow or something. I would appreciate it if you could help me with the task assigned to me.",
	"724833": "After saying this, Tesshi Issatsu left the room and closed the door to Kyuushou's room on his way out.",
	"724834": "What the heck is that guy .......",
	"724835": "Kyuushou looked in the direction she left and sighed.",
	"724836": "The \"Care Project\" or whatever it's called, why all of a sudden--?",
	"724837": "As I sighed, a sound came from the earphone in my hand. It was a call from a number I often see.",
	"724838": "Hello, Sirin. .......",
	"724839": "Ah, I arrived in New York.",
	"724840": "...... Manga Fair? Of course I'll be there!",
	"724841": "Kukuku - this savior-sama, this Houraiji Kukuso-sama, must definitely go to show himself!",
	"724842": "Next day.",
	"724843": "Kyuushou finished dressing and getting ready to leave.",
	"724844": "Iron Master Issatsu is looking at Kyuushou.",
	"724845": "Cheering lights and ...... gloves are ...... OK, we're ready to go!",
	"724846": "Manga Fair - Manga Fair - I'm coming!",
	"724847": "It's hot. ......",
	"724848": "Hey, Issatsu, you look very pale.",
	"724849": "Could you please not call me that ...... such a familiar name?",
	"724850": "It doesn't matter if you're close or not. It's just a hassle to call them by their full name.",
	"724852": "That look ...... you don't want me to go to the comic book fair?",
	"724853": "How can I say ...... that such an event will help the youth to cultivate their sentiments and deepen friendships among people of the same age, but it will be going at a windy time like now! And even if I say it's a good idea, the person in charge of the Care Project is .......",
	"724854": "I told you to tell me the purpose of your activities in advance, and now you are complaining about it. After all, you just want to keep me on a tight leash and monitor me so that I can't move!",
	"724855": "No, not me, .......",
	"724856": "Hah ....... Enough, I know I have no business being angry with you.",
	"724857": "By the way, Issatsu, Kurosawa-sama is going to go to the Manga Fair now to meet Sirin. No matter what happens, I'll definitely go there today.",
	"724858": "What will you do? Do you want to go with me in the car or stay here?",
	"724859": "...... haha. I understand. It's my job too.",
	"724860": "We have a car parked downstairs, so come with us to the venue.",
	"724862": "A huge banner hangs above the venue. The banner, which reads \"HOUKAI SHOW\" from left to right, shines in the sunlight.",
	"724863": "It's a huge comic book fair titled \"Commemorating the Fight Against Honkai and Honoring the Heroes Who Saved Mankind.\" Even from the entrance one can see many strangely dressed cosplayers.",
	"724864": "I knew at a glance what the cosplay was about.",
	"724865": "Kiana, Mei Senpai, Estherine, and then ...... Oh! There's even a cosplay of Kyuushou-sama. And there seem to be the most of them!",
	"724866": "I see cosplayers other than the heroes of Honkai - like Eris from \"Nine Days and Nights\" and Constantine from \"Eternal Night of the Devil's Castle\". And ...... Mwah, what's that?",
	"724867": "Kula--",
	"724868": "Oh, that's right. I remember. It's Clafatilla from \"The Archipelago of Stars!",
	"724869": "Kyuushou excitedly and happily entered the venue with countless cosplayers. Tesshi Issatsu, who was standing by his side, looked very bored.",
	"724870": "...... Houraiji, can I ask you one question, if you don't mind me asking? Don't you ...... think ...... people are floating around too much?",
	"724871": "Why?",
	"724872": "It is ...... you fought for a long time, overcame many dangers, and finally exterminated Honkai and saved humanity.",
	"724873": "But now that it is the subject of cosplay, don't you think it's a little less majestic than ...... quintessence?",
	"724874": "You know who you are too, don't you? In the main publicity for the victory, Kiana Kasrana, Raiden Mei, and Houraiji Kyuushou, you can also visit .......",
	"724875": "The victory, which was made possible through the efforts and sacrifices of all of you, is not being treated appropriately.",
	"724876": "And the main credit goes to the great leadership and coordination of the Human Contractors Federation. The \"real heroes,\" on the other hand, are so concerned about privacy and safety that some have not even released their names and photos to the outside world.",
	"724877": "The department downstairs from mine specializes in deleting such personal images and information.",
	"724878": "--Hoon, that's old-fashioned thinking.",
	"724879": "You talk about solemnity, but I didn't feel any of that when I was fighting the Honkai of .......",
	"724880": "That battle was very eerie and warped.",
	"724881": "However, I have finally been able to live up to the present time by thinking about the happiness I had before, my friends nearby, and all kinds of people .......",
	"724882": "For me, it doesn't matter if it is solemn or not.",
	"724883": "Seeing everyone's smiling faces in this way is the happiest and most meaningful thing of all.",
	"724884": "Hu haha! The ...... saviors are happy to fight only to protect everyone, not to fight for a world where everyone looks stiff!",
	"724885": "Even if the people you saved don't recognize you as heroes at all?",
	"724886": "What about it.",
	"724887": "The way everyone is looking at this place right now, at this venue, says it all, doesn't it?",
	"724888": "As Kyuushou headed for the entrance, Sirin, who was waiting for him, waved to Kyuushou.",
	"724889": "Kyuuksiao-sama~! This way, this way!",
	"724890": "Iron Master Issatsu followed Kyuushou as he thought about something and watched the two meet.",
	"724891": "And no other words were uttered.",
	"724892": "But see .......",
	"724893": "(You think it doesn't matter if it's solemn or not?)",
	"724894": "(Very easy going and big hearted.)",
	"724895": "(Is this the mindset of a true hero who was destined to be a hero from birth?)",
	"724896": "The manga fair is very much alive at the venue.",
	"724897": "The emcee was speaking loudly on the stage in the center of the room.",
	"724898": "Next up is the big event of the HOUKAI SHOW: the Kyuushou Cosplay Contest!",
	"724899": "'As you all know! Those who know--Houraiji Kyuushou-sama is one of the heroes who saved mankind!\"",
	"724900": "\"--The three main characteristics represented by the bandages, the cape, and the long purple hair are well known to all of you without me having to mention them now.\"",

	"724902": "I'm sure you've seen the cosplayer there on the outside of the crowd at ....... He looks just like Kyuushou-sama, and \"Sirin\" next to him also looks like the real thing. ...... But who is that fellow by his side cosplaying? Someone who wasn't very popular during the Honkai Wars?\"",
	"724904": "Kyuushou-sama, that moderator, could he be referring to Sirin and the others?",
	"724905": "I know, right? ...... I never thought there was such a thing as a \"Kyuushou Cosplay Contest\". Hahaha, interesting! Let's challenge this savior himself in person!",
	"724906": "If Kyuso-sama competes, he will definitely win, right?",
	"724907": "Hmph, the first prize is already in my hands!",
	"724908": "Um, wait a minute--",
	"724909": "What now? We've come all the way to a comic book fair and we can't even enter a little contest?",
	"724910": "...... It's a small event, but we still have to report it. Also, since we are not allowed to talk about anything related to the Jinki-ren--.",
	"724911": "Tesshi Issatsu touched the badge-shaped camera on his chest and made a gesture as if he was going to operate something. Without waiting for a decision, however, Kyuushou went up on stage first.",
	"724912": "Yes, yes, report back if you want to report back. I'm in - let's go, Sirin!",
	"724913": "Hai~yes, Kyuushou-sama!",
	"724914": "Wait. .......",
	"724916": "Congratulations to \"Number 25. This \"Kyuushou Cosplay Contest\", you are in second place! Here's your prize, go ahead!\"",
	"724917": "...... Eh, wait a minute. Our second place?",
	"724918": "Yes, unfortunately. Your costumes and makeup could not be closer to Houraiji Kyuushou's, but they fell a little short in one very important detail.",
	"724919": "A fine point? What do you mean!",
	"724920": "'Ahahaha, I'll let the first place in this competition - number 7 - set the example for us on that.",
	"724921": "Hmph--",
	"724922": "That cosplay of yours may be top-notch among ordinary cosplayers. I would say that you are close to this savior.",
	"724923": "But alas, this savior's middle two sickly qualities are not enough at all!",
	"724924": "The savior, Kyuushou-sama, is constantly setting his own chuunibyou spirit ablaze. Hahahahaha, behold, this is the \"Great Cosmic Yūmei Spiral Killing\" of this savior!",
	"724925": "...... What the hell is this? I am not like this!",
	"724926": "And it's really embarrassing ...... to have someone else play you right in front of you!",
	"724928": "Yes! Now, finally, everyone around the stage can join me at ------\"",
	"724929": "\"Super Spiral Pluto Dawn Moon Flame Dragon Breaking! --Thank you all!\"",
	"724930": "Ugh, Kyuushou-sama ....... You didn't win first place in the \"Lady Kurosawa Cosplay Contest\", did you? There must have been some mistake somewhere. Sirin is going to complain to the organizers.",
	"724931": "Enough ...... I don't care at all about these cosplay conventions because they are just doing their elaborate impressions. ......",
	"724932": "But I'm a little concerned that the image people have of this messiah is not what I thought it would be. ......",
	"724933": "Kyuushou-sama is Kyuushou-sama. I don't think you need to worry about what kind of image other people have of you.",
	"724934": "To Sirin, Kyuushou-sama is a hero who is always pursuing what is in his heart, not someone who cares only about what others think!",
	"724935": "Hahaha, yes indeed.",
	"724936": "Looks like they are playing some games on that stage over there. Let's go check it out!",
	"724937": "Wait a minute ...... huh ...... wait ...... please .......",
	"724938": "All right, all right. You need to report back to me, don't you? I wish Kazumasa would have said something appropriate on my behalf.",
	"724939": "Watching Kyuushou pull Sirin's hand and run happily away, Iron Master Issatsu sighed as if he had no choice and followed after her.",
	"724941": "Time passed.",
	"724942": "The venue for the HOUKAI SHOW.",
	"724943": "Kyuushou and Sirin seemed to have unlimited energy. They went around the exhibition hall without showing any signs of boredom and looked at each booth with great interest.",
	"724944": "Of the three, only Iron Master Issatsu tried to maintain his vigilance, but he was already exhausted, both physically and mentally.",
	"724945": "Don't you know that those two ...... are tired?",
	"724946": "To regain his strength, Issatsu Tesshi sat on a bench in an open field of view not far from the two men and continued to monitor their situation a dozen meters away.",
	"724947": "On second thought, perhaps it is just as well.",
	"724948": "A warrior who can stand up to Honkai is a force to be reckoned with.",
	"724949": "If this world were a play, these women would be the stars on the stage.",
	"724950": "For a moment, Issatsu Tesshi felt as if he were dizzy.",
	"724951": "Was it because I was tired from running around all day?",
	"724952": "\"...... hey?\"",
	"724953": "I heard a girl's voice coming from somewhere. It sounded very familiar.",
	"724954": "Iron Master Issatsu turned toward the voice.",
	"724955": "\"...... Kyuushou Houraiji? You're already--\"",
	"724956": "No, it wasn't. As soon as I asked her that, I knew immediately. The child was not Houraiji Kyuushou - but she looked very much like Kyuushou, both in clothing and appearance.",
	"724957": "...... I got called \"Houraiji Kyuushou\" again. ......",
	"724958": "The girl looked somewhat disappointed and sighed.",
	"724959": "I understand .......",
	"724960": "\"Carola Fermonde.\" ......, is it?",
	"724962": "Yay, I'm so happy! You're the first one to guess what my cosplay is at this comic book fair!",
	"724963": "The clothes that Carola Felmond wears look exactly like Houraiji Kyuushou, and the work itself is not very popular, so whenever I cosplay, I always get mistaken for him! Siksik .......",
	"724964": "Ah, well, don't worry too much about it. ......",
	"724965": "Ah, yes, by the way, what kind of character are you?",
	"724966": "Is he the hero of some game? I'm not sure either - I think he's the hero of a competitive game. ......",
	"724968": "No, it is not.",
	"724969": "I am not a hero or anything like that, I am just a company employee.",
	"724970": "That's right. .......",
	"724971": "After saying this, Iron Master Issatsu got up from the bench he was sitting on and left the girl, heading toward Kyuushou and Sirin.",
	"724973": "Thus ended my day at the comic book fair.",
	"724974": "Iron Master Issatsu left the venue with Kyuushou and Sirin.",
	"724975": "Sitting in the backseat of the car, they are talking happily.",
	"724976": "That game called \"Honkai Beast Connections\" was really fun. Even though it was a game, it was somehow more interesting than fighting Honkai in real life.",
	"724977": "Phew. Kyuushou-sama, let's go have fun together again sometime!",
	"724978": "Of course. And the \"Super Hero Show\" was great. I laughed so hard my tummy hurt at the \"Human Qi Congress Theater.\" ......",
	"724979": "The two in the backseat are laughing happily, while Iron Master Issatsu continues to drive quietly.",
	"724980": "Then words were uttered that were not expected.",
	"724981": "Did you find anything interesting in today's HOUKAI SHOW in Issatsu?",
	"724983": "Tetsushi Issatsu still felt uncomfortable being called \"Issatsu. It was because it seemed as if she was confusing her professional and personal lives.",
	"724984": "Issatsu Tesshi did not want to bring work into his normal life. But even if he tried to get the other party to change its call, it was clear that there was nothing he could do about it for a terminal staffer like himself.",
	"724985": "Besides, come to think of it, it must have been easier to carry out the three-day \"protection (surveillance) mission\" if the person to whom the mission was assigned was so approachable.",
	"724986": "Just three more days to go, and in three days the annual meeting of the Federation of Human Contractors will be over. The only thing I have ever had going for me is patience. All I have to do is to keep exercising that sole ability.",
	"724987": "Iron Master Issatsu thought so, and stopped refusing to accept Kyuushou's address to him.",
	"724988": "...... Nothing particularly interesting was found.",
	"724989": "I am past the age of dreaming.",
	"724990": "Hohoho.",
	"724991": "You say that, but I saw you. I saw you talking with a girl at one of the comic book fairs!",
	"724992": "I couldn't imagine it at all. ...... You actually like Ichika too, don't you?",
	"724994": "It's okay to be honest about your feelings, isn't it?",
	"724996": "In the end, the question was never answered until the very end.",
	"724997": "After dropping them off, Issatsu Tesshi did not return to her room. As she exited the building and got into her car again, the phone rang.",
	"724998": "It was a call from a man who seemed cold.",
	"724999": "Now come to headquarters and give me a progress report on the mission.\"",
	"725000": "I understand.",
	"725001": "The car started.",
	"725002": "Human Contractors Federation headquarters office.",
	"725003": "127th floor.",
	"725004": "Palin!",
	"725005": "The first sound that arose there was the sound of a coffee cup flying past my ear and breaking against the wall behind me.",
	"725006": "What followed was a so-called solo \"opera\" that sounded from the boss's chattering, noisy mouth.",
	"725007": "...... It's a humiliation. It is a disgrace to our \"Care Project Special Team\". We can't believe that the subject came to New York without even knowing what the signs were. This is a mistake that we should continue to reflect on for three months. ......",
	"725008": "You are the cause of ...... this humiliation. If only the Iron Master Issatsu ...... you had been more diligent in your work, ...... this would not have happened. ......",
	"725009": "...... You do realize that Houraiji Kyuushou's visit to New York has kept senior officials and congressional members of the Human Qi Federation awake at night, don't you?",
	"725010": "In seven days, or even seven hours, she can burn to ashes the most important command center for the entire human race.",
	"725011": "......Don't think of Houraiji Kyuushou as just a high school girl. She is a monster a thousand times more dangerous than a nuclear weapon. Please be more solemn .......",
	"725012": "The boss's mouth keeps moving without stopping. Sometimes the bass tone continues, sometimes it is deafeningly high-pitched.",
	"725013": "Iron Master Issatsu continued to stand with his head bowed, quietly listening to his boss's words.",
	"725014": "How much more do we have to hear before this performance artist is satisfied?",
	"725015": "I'm asexual and tired. ......",
	"725016": "This is what work is. It doesn't change when you do another job.",
	"725017": "I've been working here for years now and I haven't gotten ...... used to it at all. ...... Am I still like a leftover with poor quality?",
	"725018": "Tetsushi Issatsu's gaze turned to the pothos in front of his desk. The green leaves were swaying slightly in the cool air of the air conditioning.",
	"725019": "...... Yes. You are right.",
	"725020": "From now on, I will try to perform my duties more appropriately.",
	"725021": "Mm, just know.",
	"725022": "Perhaps it was because the dignitary in the next room was already satisfied with the conversation. The artist coughed and stopped his performative tone.",
	"725023": "Listen, the headquarters of the Jinki-ren is an organization that leads humanity into the future, a place where the elite gather. Even here, if you don't excel, you will be forced to quit. You know what happens if you make a mistake.",
	"725024": "However, it seems that you have succeeded in closing the distance between Houraiji and Kyuushou quite well in your contact with them so far. In that respect, you are carrying out my instructions well, so you should proceed even more successfully.",
	"725025": "The annual meeting of the Human Contractors Federation has been taking place for the past few days, and special figures such as Houraiji Kyuushou have the power to have a very significant impact on the outcome of the annual meeting.",
	"725026": "If she were to say that she did not like someone, even if she did not mean what she said, it could cause a worldwide upheaval.",
	"725027": "Continue to maintain a good relationship with Houraiji Kyuushou--and make sure that she does not say anything negative about the Jinki-ren headquarters during the meeting. As long as you can do that, both you and I will be further valued by the headquarters.",
	"725028": "Do you understand?",
	"725029": "I understand .......",
	"725030": "I can't hear you.",
	"725031": "I understand! I will continue to learn from the instructions you gave me and do my best!",
	"725032": "Tesshi Issatsu heard her own body screaming so.",
	"725033": "Okay, you can go back. You'll continue to \"protect\" Houraiji Kyuushou.",
	"725034": "Remember to be vigilant. The guys in Geneva are quiet for now, but there is no guarantee that they won't try something. ...... If you notice anything, report the situation immediately.",
	"725035": "I understand.",
	"725036": "Wait a minute.",
	"725038": "Clean up the pieces of the coffee cup before you go.",
	"725039": ".............................. .............................. .............................. .................. Yes.",
	"725041": "The elevator descends from the 127th floor down, stopping occasionally at the floors along the way. Tetsushi Issatsu stood in the corner of the elevator and watched the elite men dressed in suits and leather shoes who worked at the headquarters get in and out of the elevator.",
	"725042": "Each of them was different from the other, but they all shared a common expression of vanity and impatience. It was as if the light of the elevator illuminated the illusory masks on their faces.",
	"725043": "Tesshi Issatsu sometimes wondered if such a mask had been put on his face as well.",
	"725044": "(I'm tired. ............ If I work a little harder, I can go back to the hotel and sleep. .......)",
	"725045": "With this in mind, I rode the elevator for five minutes and finally made it to the first floor.",
	"725046": "The evening sun streamed in through the large glass automatic doors, illuminating the floor of the spacious hall.",
	"725047": "Behind the sunlight was a reception desk, illuminated by artificial light. I saw a person in a receptionist's uniform looking busy, and then I saw a familiar figure there.",
	"725048": "Ah, Issatsu!",
	"725049": "Mr. Ado.",
	"725050": "...... Are you on duty today?",
	"725051": "Oh, yeah. My senior asked me to take his place. Thanks to that, my vacation was ruined. ...... I was originally planning to use my vacation to go on a blind date.",
	"725052": "Didn't we have a blind date the other day?",
	"725053": "...... Oh, that thing the other day? I'm done with him - he pretended to be so able-bodied, but when I secretly checked him out, he was renting a house and a car.",
	"725054": "How, since I'm your partner, I must be pretty good at it too. These espionage abilities and such~.",
	"725055": "I'm at that age now, and I'd like to find a good marriage partner, but you can't let your guard down at any time.",
	"725056": "My parents also told me that if I had no more prospects, they would find someone of the right family background.",
	"725057": "That's right. .......",
	"725058": "But if it's Kazuhatsu, isn't that just a little too much of a tease?",
	"725059": "I'm not good at all. ......",
	"725060": "Don't be so modest! How are you? Have you found someone nice?",
	"725061": "......I've never thought about that kind of thing.",
	"725062": "I get it! Issatsu is going to climb up to a very high post and seduce a young man who just entered with a sissy tone, isn't she?",
	"725063": "You know, I know a very accurate fortune-telling site. I heard that it can completely predict how your future marriage will turn out. Would you like to try it?",
	"725064": "The girl talking with Tesshi Kazumatsu is Mo Kan'on, a native of Shenzhou. The two had met during a previous exchange program at Tesshi Kazatsu's school.",
	"725065": "I'll pass. I have work now.",
	"725066": "Care of Heroes ...... and so on.",
	"725067": "What, you mean that \"With the Sunshine\" project?",
	"725068": "Do you know, Mr. Ado?",
	"725069": "Of course I know, because ...... receptionists get all sorts of information.",
	"725070": "I've heard that the work of the Global Hero Care Project is an extremely demanding assignment.",
	"725071": "Well, it's an order from headquarters, but the chiefs in charge of the mission don't let it be their own underlings, they almost always let it be someone they don't find interesting.",
	"725072": "That way, if something should go wrong, it will be easier to hold them accountable. If things go well, the credit goes to you, and no matter how things turn out, the chiefs won't lose anything.",
	"725073": "One summer, you .......",
	"725074": "Yes, that's the reality. I'm not very popular from the top.",
	"725075": "You know, maybe not--I heard that Dr. Estherine of the \"With the Sunlight\" project and others are very personable. They say the only ones who are really hard to work with are young kids like Houraiji Kyuushou.",
	"725076": "Yes ...... its Kyuushou Houraiji.",
	"725077": "Oh, .......",
	"725078": "Thanks for all the information, \"Ei\". It's helped me understand where I stand.",
	"725079": "But you can also visit .......",
	"725080": "......Well, work is always like that, isn't it?",
	"725082": "I returned to the hotel. For some reason, the room was unusually hot and humid.",
	"725083": "I couldn't stand it and turned on the air conditioner, but all that came out was a warm breeze that irritated people.",
	"725084": "I'm tired, but I can't sleep at all.",
	"725085": "Hoping that sleep would eventually come, I turned on the TV to hear the latest news.",
	"725086": "The caster's voice that I hear seems too loud.",
	"725087": "Experts are suggesting that the earthquakes and tsunamis that have been occurring more frequently around the world in recent days may be harbingers of some kind of new geological activity. ......",
	"725088": "Conflicts are brewing around the world, and all eyes are on whether the Federation of People's Contractors can bring them to a resolution at this annual meeting. ......",
	"725089": "Emile, the \"Queen of Pops,\" has postponed her world tour again. Officials say the postponement is due to civil unrest in the country. ...... Emile is a very rare type of musician who can do it all, and has dominated in various genres from folk songs to rock to animation songs! .......\"",
	"725090": "The missing Fifth Fleet of the Jinqiren has finally been found. It is located at .......\"",
	"725091": "All of this is disturbing news.",
	"725092": "Just like how I feel now.",
	"725093": "I turned off the TV.",
	"725094": "Suddenly, the phone rang. It was a number I would never forget. I answered the phone, feeling heavy.",
	"725095": "Hello, Issatsu, how is work these days?",
	"725096": "I wanted to say a lot of things.",
	"725097": "I wanted to complain a lot.",
	"725098": "But in the end, I answered as I always do--",
	"725099": "......Nothing wrong with that, Mom.",
	"725100": "I'm glad to hear it then. ...... Kazatsu, you have to do it right because the Jinki-ren HQ is a place that produces all the elites.",
	"725101": "I hear it's tough to find a job these days? The kid next door has been hanging around for about 6 months now, and he was a ...... decent kid, but he can't seem to get a job. So, you know, his parents came to visit me and asked me to help him out. They asked if you could get her a job.",
	"725103": "But don't worry, I made sure I said no.",
	"725104": "Thanks, Mom.",
	"725105": "Oh no, don't thank me for that. You're working hard and working your way up at Jin Qi Ren HQ, so you shouldn't do anything that would tarnish your reputation at this time of year - I've never had a great job like that, but I know that much common sense.",
	"725106": "In the future, if I ever get to be a big shot, then I'd be willing to do that much. But right now, I'm still in the stage where I'm trying to grow every day. --Yes, Issatsu, how is your relationship with your boss?",
	"725107": "...... its, not really a problem.",
	"725108": "You have to keep a close relationship with your boss. You have to be smiling and you have to be smiling when you are smiling. If you have an assignment, take the initiative and do it. It's through these things that you will be able to move forward. Understand?",
	"725109": "...... yes yes yes.",
	"725110": "I know you are not good at that. But think about it. You have worked so hard from junior high school to college. We, your parents, worked very hard to raise you, and you have finally made it this far.",
	"725111": "The reality we have now was obtained through hard work, so we have to be more realistic and smarter about it.",
	"725112": "...... I know, I know, I know.",
	"725113": "I don't like to say these things too much, but I need you to get it right.",
	"725114": "Speaking of which, are you dating anyone these days?",
	"725115": "I'm not here.",
	"725116": "Why don't you start looking?",
	"725117": "When I was your mother's age, I had children roughly your age now.",
	"725118": "But when you are looking for a partner, you have to think about the family background of the person you are looking for and your own situation.",
	"725119": "...... Of course, I'm not saying you absolutely have to marry a high-ranking or wealthy person. The most important thing is character. But at the very least, you have to marry someone from a middle class or above family. To avoid hardships in the future.",
	"725120": "Issatsu, are you listening?",
	"725121": "...... yeah.",
	"725122": "You may think it's a lot of small talk and a lot of trouble, but this is all important. One day you will understand.",
	"725123": "--Well, that's that then. I'm sure you're busy at work, so I'm going to go now.",
	"725124": "The phone went dead and a poo-poo sound was heard.",
	"725125": "Iron Master Issatsu held his phone and stared at the TV, which was turned off with a blank expression on his face.",
	"725126": "I could see in my mind's eye how it was when I talked to Moochangone.",
	"725127": "Marriage ......?",
	"725128": "You date people, get married, have children and raise them. And watch them grow up until their teeth fall out and they are wrinkled. ......",
	"725129": "Even if I try to imagine such a scene, I can't really feel anything. And even if I imagine such a thing, I can't feel any emotion related to \"happiness.",
	"725130": "But in the future, which we cannot foresee, we may go down that road. In any case, my family stands neither near nor far, looking at me with expectant eyes all the time...... or rather, urging me to do so, rather than looking at me with expectant eyes.",
	"725131": "All for you.",
	"725132": "But maybe doing so will give you a real sense of happiness ...... and allow you to live a faceless life as a normal adult .......",
	"725133": "......Let's turn off the lights now.",
	"725134": "I was walking to turn off the light when I tripped on something and almost fell. My umbrella got caught on my foot.",
	"725135": "It was a long umbrella, not a folding one. When folded, it looked like a sword with a handle. On the handle was engraved in warped characters the name of the sword that Moo-san had worn in junior high school.",
	"725136": "Why have I been using such a hard-to-use umbrella for so long without throwing it away?",
	"725137": "I think the Iron Master Issatsu is waiting for nature to break him.",
	"725138": "It is not a legendary weapon, but merely a mediocre mechanical production, so it is bound to break down at some point.",
	"725139": "Yes, you can throw it away when the time comes.",
	"725140": "Iron Master Issatsu turned off the light while talking to himself.",
	"725144": "The next day, the central laboratory of the Human Contractors Federation.",
	"725145": "Today is the day Houraiji Kyuushou was originally scheduled to meet with Estherine and others.",
	"725146": "In the laboratory, Estherine was explaining to Kyuushou and Tesshi Issatsu about her latest research project.",
	"725147": "This is a fund project I've been involved in recently with the Japan Federation of Economic Cooperation and Development. It's called the Future Farm Plan, and it's mainly for consumer use.",
	"725148": "The Future Farm Plan has three programs--Time Farm, Space Farm, and Ocean Farm.",
	"725149": "At Time Farms, we are primarily interested in accelerating the growth of conventional crops such as millet, rice, and corn, as well as significantly increasing yields.",
	"725150": "At the Space Farm, we're working on mutations of conventional crops and new homologous heterogeneous crops--",
	"725151": "At the marine farm, I'm designing a modularized production line that covers everything from algae and other marine plant production to detoxification treatment and food processing.",
	"725152": "I'm already seeing results with this project. For example, see .......",
	"725153": "There was no sign of an end to that long explanation.",
	"725154": "Tesshi Issatsu vaguely heard what it said.",
	"725155": "Looking around, Iron Master Issatsu noticed Kyuushou yawning loudly nearby.",
	"725156": "I don't know why ......, but I suddenly remembered my high school days. It was spring or fall, and there was usually someone looking sleepy in physics or chemistry class.",
	"725157": "...... I couldn't help but feel nostalgic about such things.",
	"725158": "Is this, by any chance, because I am getting older?",
	"725159": "Suddenly, Issatsu Tesshi felt his body shake.",
	"725160": "Could this be a precursor to time travel back to when I was 16 or 7 years old trying to doze off in class or something? Like a common development in novels!",
	"725161": "Kazumatsu Tesshi looked around with his eyes wide open and realized that it was not time travel, but a real physical phenomenon - a real phenomenon.",
	"725162": "The body was not shaking; the ground was shaking.",
	"725163": "...... this?",
	"725164": "Earthquake.",
	"725165": "But not too strong. It shouldn't be a problem.",
	"725166": "Oh, by the way, on the news a few days ago they were saying there have been a lot of earthquakes and tsunamis lately. I believe it has something to do with geological activity. ......",
	"725167": "--I don't think this has anything to do with Honkai?",
	"725168": "It's okay~. Femirins checked with our monitoring resources in various locations and found no evidence of Honkai energy. I think it is just crustal activity.",
	"725169": "Okay, now that the quake has subsided, I'll continue with the ...... explanation--",
	"725170": "Here are some of the results already obtained from the Future Farm Plan Formulas for using new technologies to accelerate crop maturation and growth, already identified. Some of them can be found at .......",
	"725171": "I've also devised a way to experiment with using the gravity of Kyuushou's black hole to speed up the growth of crops by altering the space-time around the field, but I'm still brushing up on that method. ......",
	"725172": "Real-time images from the \"Future Farm Plan\" were displayed on the screen.",
	"725173": "While watching the \"Ocean Farm\" video, Kazumasa Tesshi noticed something crossed his path at great speed.",
	"725174": "That one you just saw is .......",
	"725175": "That's a mockup of the Human Qi Federation's Moonlight Throne. It is the pride of the Fifth Fleet. It is a super battleship \"Yamazato,\" which is close to the theoretical limit in terms of size.",
	"725176": "Because the disaster of the Honkai has subsided and many technologies that were classified before the war have been lifted, and many of them are now being used to experiment with weapons. This is part of that.",
	"725177": "...... I see.",
	"725178": "But there is a limit to the power of simple weapons. Now, the strongest is still mankind itself. And the most powerful being in the world is...",
	"725179": "Lord Kyuushou, how strong are you now?",
	"725180": "You mean me. ....... I've never given it my all since I signed the contract with the HQ of the Federation of People's Contractors. So I don't know how much power I have left.",
	"725181": "Right, well, that's quite natural.",
	"725182": "Hey, you're listening to me correctly. I'm going to talk about the core of the Future Farm Plan now. I'm going to talk about the formulas and line processes for each part, but here's the first part--",
	"725183": "Estherine's voice is like the sound of a demon that lulls the listener to sleep or something, dulling his or her thoughts.",
	"725184": "Tesshi Kazatsu sighed and looked around, and saw Kyuushou's sleepy face. Then she said as if an idea had occurred to her.",
	"725185": "Houraiji, are you bored ......?",
	"725186": "To avoid being noticed by those around him, Iron Master Issatsu secretly asked Kyuushou.",
	"725187": "Eh - oh, a little bit.",
	"725188": "If you are bored, why do you continue to stay in this place?",
	"725189": "You're not talking about ...... Estherine, but the reason why you're here. Last time I came here on my own from Changkuu City to this town where the headquarters is located, and even yesterday I went to a comic book fair because it was interesting....... I thought I would be giving you a lot of trouble.",
	"725190": "...... eh?",
	"725191": "So, if you spend all day at a human-rights organization like this, it will make you feel a little better, don't you think?",
	"725192": "Besides, hasn't the Federation of Human Contractors held its annual meeting recently?",
	"725193": "I don't feel very good about it, but I can understand why the headquarters of ...... would want to strictly control the actions of our \"special people\" and why they are doing so many things.",
	"725194": "...... that .......",
	"725195": "Thank you for your concern. Mr. Kyuushou.",
	"725196": "Kukuku...... finally called me by my first name!",
	"725197": "While they were talking, Estherine's explanation finally finished.",
	"725198": "Now that the briefing is over, let's take the next break. Please come this way--",
	"725199": "Now, here's the rec room: ...... It doesn't have anything particularly interesting, but I think it could be used for a break.",
	"725200": "You said, \"There's nothing particularly interesting\" ...... There's really nothing there but one karaoke machine!",
	"725201": "Well, it's a laboratory. Even if there is an entertainment type of thing, it will only discourage researchers. ...... Scientific research can only be blessed with great results if you concentrate and devote yourself to it.",
	"725202": "Kuh, I can't help it. ...... What kind of songs does this karaoke machine have in it? ...... \"Burning Angel's Flame\", \"Chanting of Twilight\", \"Eternal Love Song\"... ....",
	"725203": "You're a very simple machine, but you understand the demand for the music you deliver!",
	"725204": "They are all my favorite songs!",
	"725205": "Hmmm...you are quite good at pleasing this savior.",
	"725206": "If so, Femirins will be the one to light it up for you! --How about this?",
	"725207": "Hmph, good one, Femirins. I always thought of a laboratory as a grim place, but not bad.",
	"725208": "Let me start by presenting \"The Ice Wars\" -- a book about the",
	"725209": "Memories of a faraway time~♪",
	"725210": "\"Overture to an old saying...\"",
	"725211": "♪ \"The light shines and the town trembles ♪♪",
	"725212": "The angel of ice will descend soon~♪\"",
	"725213": ".......\"",
	"725214": "Okay, now for a duet. Who wants to sing with me?",
	"725215": "Do you think I can sing?",
	"725216": "Sorry, I'm going out for a moment to take a call.",
	"725217": "Kuh, one after another ...... Then Ichinatsu, you sing with me.",
	"725218": "Don't worry. The tune is simple and you can just hum along.",
	"725219": "Iron Master Issatsu shook his head repeatedly at Kyuushou's request, but in the end, he could not let Kyuushou's feelings go unanswered, and he had no choice but to grab the microphone.",
	"725220": "And after a while--",
	"725221": "Oh ...... this is great!",
	"725222": "One summer, can you sing ani-songs perfectly?",
	"725223": "Eh, this is such a big deal .......",
	"725224": "Kukuku, excessive modesty is a sign of confidence, isn't it? Now, let's find out the true strength hidden in you, my lord!",
	"725226": "I couldn't tell you how much I had already sung.",
	"725227": "I sweated a lot.",
	"725228": "Before long, Estherine and Femirins were caught up in the atmosphere, and together with Kyuushou, they truly enjoyed themselves in front of the small karaoke machine.",
	"725229": "Finally having time to catch his breath, Tesshi Issatsu walked out of the recreation room as he went to the bathroom.",
	"725230": "Hah .......",
	"725231": "Originally I was just going to match them to mend the situation, but in the end I got really excited and joined in with them. ......",
	"725232": "...... Is this because I'm still immature?",
	"725233": "Iron Master Issatsu shook his head. I suddenly noticed someone standing at the end of the hallway. It was someone unexpected.",
	"725235": "Iron Master Issatsu immediately straightened his back and attempted to bow.",
	"725236": "Houraiji Kyuushou is a hero but an ordinary high school student, Estherine is also a hero but not in any official position. Ms. Femirins is also a hero, but she is an AI.",
	"725237": "But Mr. Shicheng is a member of the board of directors of the Japan Federation of Trade Unions, and to me, he is the boss of the boss of the boss of the boss of the boss.",
	"725238": "You don't have to be so awed.",
	"725239": "After she said this, Shizoku Yong smiled at Tesshi Issatsu and stopped her from trying to break her waist deeply.",
	"725240": "Shicheng Xue looked as if he was thinking about something and tilted his head a little. I could not tell what he was thinking from his expression and gestures.",
	"725241": "Director Moderator, was there anything at ......?",
	"725242": "...... No, it's nothing.",
	"725243": "I just remembered something.",
	"725244": "The officiant smiled at her again.",
	"725245": "Let's go back to the recreation room ...... soon or Kyuushou and the others might come looking for us because they're worried about us.",
	"725246": "By the time we left the laboratory, the sun had set.",
	"725247": "The sparse starlight was not enough to illuminate the jet-black tent. The stars in the sky looked as if they were inlaid.",
	"725248": "Hmmm... ...... I really enjoyed myself today. It was as good as yesterday's.",
	"725249": "Ichika, you should have told me yesterday. If you can sing maniacal ani-songs that even I don't know, you must have been interested in the Manga Fair, right?",
	"725250": "Besides, you look completely different now than you did when I first met you. Yes, ...... you are a super singer of ani-songs!",
	"725251": "...... I'm not a big fan of it. I just had a chance to know a little bit about it before.",
	"725252": "Really?",
	"725253": "Yes.",
	"725254": "The car moves along the asphalt road without swaying. The night breeze ruffles the wind outside the window, and Houraiji is smiling happily in the back seat.",
	"725255": "I don't know why ...... but it felt unreal.",
	"725256": "It was as if something very gentle was stroking the surface of my inner heart.",
	"725257": "At the same time, however, I felt an inexpressible annoyance begin to stir deep in my chest.",
	"725258": "I will park the car directly in front of the hotel in a few minutes, so please go back to your room. I have to go back to the headquarters to report again.",
	"725259": "No, I'm waiting in the car for Issatsu to come back. As I recall, the headquarters was on the way back to the hotel. Then why don't you just wait in my parking lot?",
	"725260": "Because even ...... might take a lot.",
	"725261": "It's okay!",
	"725262": "I understand .......",
	"725263": "The annoyance in my mind eased slightly.",
	"725264": "A car stopped in front of the headquarters building of the Federation of People's Trade Unions.",
	"725265": "Iron Master Issatsu entered this well-worn place.",
	"725266": "--127th floor. It's a height that inspires awe in people. The place is like a sword mine, but fortunately there is an elevator.",
	"725267": "The man, her boss, was reprimanding her as usual.",
	"725268": "The essence of life is \"movement,\" but his essence seemed to be \"blame,\" that is, cursing, satirizing, and humiliating others. Perhaps it was because he seemed as if he could not show the meaning of his own existence without doing so.",
	"725269": "You lack the ability to understand. Why didn't you listen carefully then?",
	"725270": "Information on the Shinshu branch would have to be gathered with more detail and care, though!",
	"725271": "...... your mission? The annual meeting is over tomorrow, and you say you have nothing else to do once it's over? I've told you many times. When you're not assigned a task, you find a job for yourself.",
	"725272": "If you don't want to leave here, work harder and more diligently!",
	"725274": "In a heavy atmosphere, I listened to dozens of minutes of reprimands.",
	"725275": "The moment I left the room, I felt dizzy.",
	"725276": "Was it because I stood there too long?",
	"725277": "I went to the bathroom and looked at myself in the mirror. I wondered if it was because of the high humidity today. The mirror was dim, and no matter how hard I tried to wipe it, I could not see my reflection clearly.",
	"725278": "I tried to cheer myself up by smiling, but I didn't even have the energy to smile anymore.",
	"725279": "...... phew.",
	"725280": "I washed my face with cold water. Then suddenly, the phone rang.",
	"725281": "...... Hello?",
	"725282": "Issatsu, there's something I wanted to tell you.",
	"725283": "My mother is talking excitedly on the other end of the phone.",
	"725284": "Actually, I ran into an old colleague of mine today and talked to him, and his son is also in New York. I told him about you, and he was very interested in you. I told him about you and he became very interested in you. He asked me if we could make some time to meet somewhere.",
	"725285": "Muttered,\" the caller hung up.",
	"725286": "The pent up annoyance seemed to overflow from my throat. Choking, choking, choking, choking, choking, choking, choking, choking, choking, choking, choking .......",
	"725287": "Hah .......",
	"725288": "I clenched my fists as hard as I could. She had an expression on her face that could be interpreted as either crying or laughing. Then I heard strange footsteps.",
	"725289": "Ta-tah.\"",
	"725290": "There is no one else in the bathroom.",
	"725291": "Ta-tah.\"",
	"725292": "I can certainly hear it. But it wasn't heard from the bathroom booth.",
	"725293": "Ta-tah.\"",
	"725294": "It was coming from inside the walls.",
	"725295": "Ta-tah.\"",
	"725296": "Are you finally losing your mind? Did the stress get to the point where you started hearing things?",
	"725297": "What is that sound? Is that a wall cracking? A drone? Or is it a ...... fairy?",
	"725298": ".............................. It doesn't matter. What's the point of it all?",
	"725299": "A twisted smile appeared.",
	"725300": "But soon it was gone.",
	"725301": "Choking, choking, choking. ......",
	"725302": "My head was so mushy that I felt like the world was spinning around in circles with all kinds of imaginations. I am not me, I am not Issatsu the Iron Master, I am not my parents' daughter, I am not the enforcer of the Care Project. If that's the case, then who the hell am I ......?",
	"725303": "Choking ...... dizzy, losing balance, not getting enough oxygen, falling.",
	"725304": "Fall in, fall out, fall in.",
	"725306": "It took me another dozen minutes to get out of the restroom and into the elevator.",
	"725307": "When I arrived at the elevator hall on the first floor, the woman at the reception desk stopped me.",
	"725308": "Ichinatsu-san! This way here~!",
	"725309": "It's late at night, and you're not really busy right now, are you?",
	"725310": "(Issatsu-san ......?)",
	"725311": "Yes, look at this. The fortune-telling site I was recommending yesterday--",
	"725312": "What about it?",
	"725313": "I just started another new content on this site today, look!",
	"725314": "...... \"Divination of who I was 40,000 years ago\"?",
	"725315": "According to the description, he utilizes Stigmata technology, Honkai energy, qigong, and even magnetic fields, and he's very accurate!",
	"725316": "I'll tell you just for you. Actually, I had a dream two years ago.",
	"725317": "Two years ago? About the time before Honkai was overthrown?",
	"725318": "Yes, that's why I thought I might have a sacrament. Well, maybe it's just a matter of bad sleeping habits. ...... How about you give it a try, Issatsu-san?",
	"725319": "It's not too late today. ......",
	"725320": "But, well, if it's what Mr. Ado says, you can go to .......",
	"725321": "I really want to know what Ichika's previous life was. ...... Maybe we were partners 40,000 years ago too!",
	"725322": "This girl named Moukanon was Tetsushi Issatsu's closest friend in junior high school.",
	"725323": "It was the same in junior high school, too. Back then, Isatsu-san was the head of the drama club, and he was super cool. He used to talk about going to the \"eternal world\" ......, so I thought he would like something interesting like this!",
	"725324": "......Ummm......Well, I can't say no to your request, Ado.",
	"725325": "Unable to refuse an invitation from a friend, Tetsushi Issatsu tapped the screen of his phone.",
	"725326": "Mr. Moo's eyes sparkle with interest.",
	"725327": "'Oh my God, this is you 40,000 years ago!",
	"725328": "Forty thousand years ago, a wandering swordsman charged alone to save a young girl.",
	"725329": "Seeing what was displayed on the fortune-telling screen, Ms. Miao's eyes widened in surprise.",
	"725330": "Oh my, a wandering swordsman! Ichinatsu-san is always a hero, isn't he? But why is it that the person he saves is a girl? It would have been better if it was a cool older brother or something. ......",
	"725331": "Actually, my results are pretty weird too: ...... according to it, I was a secret agent 40,000 years ago. ...... Ahhhh, a secret agent. I guess I'm not quite good enough to be Ichinatsu's partner. ......",
	"725332": "...... wandering swordsman .......",
	"725333": "I wonder if ...... really was such a cool entity?",
	"725334": "Well, isn't it only when you have hope and longing that you have the strength to live?",
	"725335": "I'm kind of ...... well okay.",
	"725336": "Iron Master Issatsu returned the phone to the adoring cold sound.",
	"725337": "I'm feeling a little under the weather, so I'll go home first.",
	"725338": "Ichinatsu!",
	"725339": "? Adore you, you .......",
	"725340": "Iron Master Issatsu found himself embraced.",
	"725341": "............ You don't have to do that.",
	"725342": "I've been under a lot of stress lately, haven't I?",
	"725343": "Let go of me. You're on duty, aren't you?",
	"725344": "When I see you having a hard time, I sigh all over myself.",
	"725345": "I hope this makes you feel a little better.",
	"725346": "I think it might be .............",
	"725347": "If you are having a hard time, you can tell me anything. We are partners.",
	"725348": "You believe I have telepathic psychic powers, don't you, Issatsu-san? That psychic power is telling me this. Someone cares about you more than you think!",
	"725350": "When she was in junior high school, Issatsu Tesshi had a vision of the future she wanted to have. Whenever this dream would swell up helplessly in her heart, she would run around the hallways and say things she didn't quite understand.",
	"725351": "At that time, it was the adoring cold sound that was decidedly following behind me.",
	"725352": "On the other hand, Moo Kanon wished that she too could be by the side of Tesshi Issatsu when his dream came true.",
	"725353": "However, Issatsu Tesshi became this Issatsu Tesshi of today. And Moo Kan'on became the Moo Kan'on of today.",
	"725354": "Now Iron Master Issatsu saw the current situation and thought, \"I'm not going to give up. It's not that I gave up, it was just too difficult. It's not my fault. It's not my fault.",
	"725355": "Every time she thought about it, she felt a little better. But at the same time, she felt ashamed.",
	"725356": "That is why Issatsu Tetsushi does not want to say what he really thinks.",
	"725357": "Then she gently undid her arm, turned and headed toward the exit.",
	"725358": "(It's kind of a fantasy. .......)",
	"725359": "(Those years have passed. .......)",
	"725361": "Finally, we returned to the parking lot. It was already midnight.",
	"725362": "All right, all right, all right. Okay, Mom, that's it. I gotta go.",
	"725363": "Did you have a fight with your family?",
	"725364": "That's not true. They just told me to go to bed early.",
	"725365": "Oh.",
	"725366": "Iron Master Issatsu sat in the driver's seat. The girl in the back seat said, \"Why are you so slow!\" and did not complain in any way. Through the rearview mirror, she could see Kyuushou looking at the seat she was sitting in with worried eyes.",
	"725367": "What's wrong with ......?",
	"725368": "Something unpleasant?",
	"725369": "...... It's okay. It's no big deal.",
	"725370": "...... There's nothing there.",
	"725371": "It should have been.",
	"725372": "I'm really getting the munchies. Why is it so hot and humid even though it's already midnight? It's so hot and humid that I feel like going crazy.",
	"725373": "He immediately started the car.",
	"725374": "Outside the window, the wind is making a screaming sound.",
	"725375": "Even with the wind beating against my face, I still feel uncomfortably hot.",
	"725376": "But Kyuushou's voice still rang out.",
	"725377": "I just can't believe he would look that gloomy when nothing was going on.",
	"725378": "......No, it's really nothing....... I'm just a little tired from work.",
	"725379": "Okay, but see .......",
	"725380": "Yes, I saw in the material that there was a reincarnation of human civilization 40,000 years ago, and the \"stigmata\" are related to that.",
	"725381": "Iron Master Issatsu suddenly broached another subject.",
	"725382": "She was surprised herself, not knowing why she had suddenly started talking about the subject.",
	"725383": "Can that \"sacrament\" really determine the future fate of humanity and the direction in which we go?",
	"725384": "Hmmm, what can I say, ...... it's too complicated to explain--",
	"725385": "Isn't the destiny of mankind, for example, what I am now, or ...... each of us decides for ourselves? Are you saying that the way people are today was already decided 40,000 years ago?",
	"725386": "Many of the documents released by the Jinki-ren are blacked out. ...... Houraiji, do you know the truth?",
	"725387": "Stigmata? Yeah, it's a--",
	"725388": "Kyuushou continued to speak fluently.",
	"725389": "Iron Master Issatsu had heard up to the words, \"The history of previous societies was indeed guided by the sacraments, but not all of the numerous heroes and great men used them,\" but he did not remember much more after that.",
	"725390": "Tesshi Issatsu looked out the window. It was dark outside, and the lights on both sides of the road were gradually dimming. The road continued on for about a kilometer until it came to a tunnel.",
	"725391": "The sound of driving echoes through the quiet tunnel, illuminated by dim orange lights. Eventually, when you exit the tunnel, you will be able to return to the world where you can see the night sky again.",
	"725392": "Like this dimly lit tunnel, will going outside clear some of the haze in my chest?",
	"725393": "Tesshi Issatsu thought so in his head.",
	"725394": "But the next moment she blinked--",
	"725395": "The world in front of me suddenly went completely dark.",
	"725396": "The sound change struck later than the light change.",
	"725397": "Boom!\"",
	"725398": "I find myself braking hard on reflex. But my head didn't understand why I was doing it.",
	"725399": "She finally understood what had happened when she saw chunks of concrete falling like rain, hitting the windshield and dust coming in through the window with the wind.",
	"725400": "The tunnel ...... collapsed?!",
	"725401": "The area is quiet.",
	"725402": "Headlights flashed on and off, illuminating the dust that enveloped the area.",
	"725403": "I managed to open the door and look in the direction I had driven, but could not see the moonlight.",
	"725404": "Here, this is .......",
	"725405": "Kazumasa, are you all right?",
	"725406": "I heard Kyuushou's voice from behind me.",
	"725407": "...... okay.",
	"725408": "However, it looks like the tunnel has completely collapsed.",
	"725409": "Is it because of the recent increase in earthquakes?",
	"725410": "Let's move on a bit.",
	"725411": "I might be able to walk out.",
	"725412": "Yes. .......",
	"725413": "They moved forward through the walls of the tunnel.",
	"725414": "The \"creaking\" sound coming from the mass of stones supporting the ceiling overhead is unsettling. It could collapse again at any moment.",
	"725416": "The girl pulled my hand.",
	"725417": "It is easier to walk this way because it is dark.",
	"725418": "......, yes.",
	"725419": "(We need to find a way out fast. .......)",
	"725420": "Sweat was pouring from his body and his palms were wet, so Kazumatsu Iron Curtain felt bad that he was being rude to Kyuushou. However, Kyuushou did not seem to mind and continued to hold Tesshuichi's hand.",
	"725421": "For Kyuushou, it didn't matter.",
	"725422": "Really .......",
	"725423": "A really pleasant person .......",
	"725424": "So I .......",
	"725425": "He quickened his walking pace.",
	"725426": "Gradually, my eyes became accustomed to the dark environment and I was able to capture the collapsed tunnel with my eyes.",
	"725427": "But at the same time, I realized--",
	"725428": "That there are rocks that are about to fall.",
	"725429": "It was a rock above Kyuushou's head.",
	"725430": "I didn't even have time to think about it, I immediately pushed the girl--",
	"725431": "...... dangerous!",
	"725432": "Rocks fell from above.",
	"725433": "The rocks in the ceiling of the broken tunnel--",
	"725434": "It hit me with a tremendous amount of force--",
	"725435": "Don!\"",
	"725438": "At first I felt nothing, but then intense pain hit my left leg. It had been caught in a falling rock. The intense pain turned into a numbing sensation after a while and did not last long.",
	"725439": "Still, I could clearly see something pouring out of the wound unstoppably, as if I had stuck a needle into a balloon.",
	"725440": "Wait for me! I will rescue you soon!",
	"725441": "When Kyuushou said this, it seemed as if something in the air around us instantly changed to something else.",
	"725442": "The rock that had been overhanging me was moved to another place as lightly as if it were a feather, and the wound in my leg was enveloped in some strange sensation. It did not heal the injury, but it almost stopped the bleeding.",
	"725443": "His body was lifted up by the girl and a panicked voice was heard in his ear.",
	"725444": "Does it still hurt? Any other injuries?",
	"725445": "I am ...... okay. How about you Kyuushou, did you hit the ...... rock?",
	"725446": "I'm sure I'm fine. Have you forgotten? I am Herrscher.",
	"725447": "...... Yes, you were, you were Herrscher.",
	"725448": "He was really an idiot. A fool who acts without thinking. No wonder my boss was angry with me every day.",
	"725449": "Because what I have in front of me is a nuclear weapon who also walks and talks.",
	"725450": "I took a quick look and it looks like it's collapsed and blocked up ahead. But that's okay, it's a good opportunity to show what I can do.",
	"725451": "So ...... I'm .......",
	"725452": "Lie down for the summer. I'll penetrate this tunnel with a single blow and take you to the hospital right away.",
	"725453": "I felt again the strange sensory surge I had felt earlier.",
	"725454": "This feeling, Honkai energy.",
	"725455": "I was one of the human beings who survived that Great War, so it wasn't like I had never felt Honkai energy.",
	"725456": "However, the vibrations of Honkai energy that were transmitted to me were more powerful than anything I had ever felt before, yet strangely gentle.",
	"725457": "This is the power of heroism. ......",
	"725458": "So ...... I would like to ...... against her.",
	"725459": "This is what ...... is all about: true heroes.",
	"725460": "...... Oh. Leave the rest to me.",
	"725461": "But ...... please don't.",
	"725463": "--What? Why?",
	"725464": "If we did that, we would be in violation of at least 14 items of the \"Care Project\" contract.",
	"725465": "The use of Honkai energy, the destruction of utilities, and the massive use of Honkai energy ...... and they do it near the headquarters of the Human Contractors Federation.",
	"725466": "No matter how ...... much I ...... defend you, you will forfeit all of your ...... allowances! .......",
	"725467": "It seems to be getting darker in front of me than it was earlier ...... and a little colder .......",
	"725468": "So ...... your best option is to stay here and wait for ...... rescue. The whole area consolidation is working, so they should be coming to your rescue soon.",
	"725469": "This is my decision as the enforcer of the ...... People's Contractors Association.",
	"725470": "What does she look like now? I can't see her anymore ...... but she, she is saying something.",
	"725471": "No problem!",
	"725472": "Things like that!",
	"725473": "I heard her voice.",
	"725474": "Ichinatsu, you are my friend. And that allowance was not originally earned by me, so I don't really care.",
	"725475": "Don't think about anything else. This savior will save Issatsu.",
	"725476": "The girl's voice was full of heroic determination.",
	"725477": "It was a voice that had walked its own path since the day it was born and knew no fear.",
	"725479": "............ Oh.",
	"725480": "I understand .......",
	"725481": "This is heroism, true heroism.",
	"725482": "He is strong, free, jovial, unhurried, calm, sensitive to others, and kind to everyone.",
	"725483": "So I ...... me.",
	"725484": "I knew it. ...... Houraiji Kyuushou, I understand. You are really a good person.",
	"725485": "Then turn your face away.",
	"725486": "So I'm going to send you an email at .......",
	"725488": "That's why I don't like you.",
	"725490": "...... heh?",
	"725491": "My head was spinning and I was leaning against the wall.",
	"725492": "The words echoed quietly, as if flowing down along with the blood.",
	"725493": "The blood that flowed down the street puddled on the ground, coming closer and closer to Kyuushou's feet.",
	"725494": "The \"With Sunlight: Postwar Special Person Care Project\" is one of the ten most important projects at the headquarters of the Jinqiren ...... and is my most important work.",
	"725495": "If you use Honkai energy here, my mission is now as good as ...... failed.",
	"725496": "If this happens, my performance will be negatively evaluated to an even greater extent. The department I am in now is in danger of being restructured at any moment, and I am sure that any mistakes in the department will be blamed on me.",
	"725497": "...... No, but that's--",
	"725498": "You may be thinking, \"What's the big deal about work?\" You might think, \"What's the big deal about work?",
	"725499": "But this is the only job I have.",
	"725500": "I have to pay rent and I have to eat. My parents fill their vanity with the fact that their \"daughter works for Jinqiren.",
	"725501": "When the Honkai occurred, I fled like a canine. At the time, my family took turns applying to purchase protective clothing, but we couldn't afford a single one.",
	"725502": "Even after the battle against Honkai was over, we had no victories or honors. We had to buy another set of furniture and stay in that noisy room, divided by that partition, which was always under construction all the time up there.",
	"725503": "I have to give up my hobbies, study diligently, and endure daily verbal abuse in the office in order to earn an annual income that is about one-tenth of your monthly allowance.",
	"725504": "People like me, who are mediocre, can be replaced by any number of people. I have to endure a lot in order not to be replaced by others.",
	"725505": "I am not a hero or a goddess of battle. I am not Herrscher, nor do I have a sacrament.",
	"725506": "It's just a few inconsequential dusty things falling for you, and my legs break and I have to crawl on my knees.",
	"725507": "In other words, I am not even qualified to play a supporting role in this world. That was already decided from the beginning.",
	"725508": "So please ......................... I don't want to lose this job.",
	"725509": ".................. er, .......",
	"725510": "Please, please, please. Herrscher, Houraiji Kyuushou. Please ...... please don't be my hero .......",
	"725512": "I can't believe you thought that. ......",
	"725513": "She was silent.",
	"725514": "Yes, ...... you despised me. ......",
	"725515": "(haha .......)",
	"725516": "I mocked myself in my mind.",
	"725517": "I began to lose consciousness.",
	"725518": "...... probably because it bled too much.",
	"725519": "But my body felt lighter.",
	"725520": "It is as if it is floating in the air.",
	"725521": "This is how I want to ...... float in the sky.",
	"725522": "That was ...... my dream when I was a little girl.",
	"725523": "But they told me, \"That's impossible.",
	"725524": "That's what you're doing at ......, isn't it?",
	"725525": "Ordinary people can't fly.",
	"725526": "Ordinary people have to follow common sense.",
	"725527": "Ordinary people must remain in a world governed by common sense.",
	"725528": "We can only live there in peace.",
	"725529": "Suddenly, I realized--",
	"725530": "That I am really floating in the air.",
	"725531": "...... but in fact it was a stretcher.",
	"725532": "Here, here! There is an injured person here--!",
	"725534": "...... I'm not the least bit angry with you after what you said to me earlier?",
	"725535": "Does a savior think that differently from ordinary people?",
	"725536": "What are you talking about? We are not fighting, are we?",
	"725537": "Issatsu confided his true feelings to me and I listened to him. That's all there is to it.",
	"725539": "You are indeed a hero to save the world. ......",
	"725540": "I chuckled.",
	"725541": "........................ I told you I don't like you, didn't I? How can you be that nice to someone who denigrates you?",
	"725542": "........................ should have been mad at me for what I said and hated me I wish I had hated you.",
	"725543": "............ so I could have a little ...... in common with you... ..........",
	"725544": "As if my whole body was wrapped in a comforter of fatigue, my eyelids gradually descended and my consciousness fell into a long dream.",
	"725546": "When I was a little girl, I was not like this.",
	"725547": "Back then, the world seemed to have just been unsealed and I was very pure.",
	"725548": "I always had the fantasy that if I could see white dolls in the drawer, they would begin to work at night, creating a doll-driven world.",
	"725549": "If there was a cloud covering the sky, he would look up at it and expect to see a shadow in the shape of a person behind the white cloud.",
	"725550": "He was immersed in semiotics and mythology, believing in the prophecies of Nostradamus, Mayan myths, and legends of ancient civilizations long ago.",
	"725551": "And .......",
	"725552": "Also about the work of heroes.",
	"725553": "Always looking forward, determined without regret, and brave enough to attract people's attention.",
	"725554": "Once they appear, they catch the attention of all people, as if burned into their retinas.",
	"725555": "Like a legend in a novel, he is a being who raises the sacred sword in the face of danger, receives eternal radiance, and splits heaven and earth.",
	"725556": "Like the hero of the game, he bravely continues on his path as a savior of the world, no matter how many scars his body may be covered with.",
	"725557": "In the midst of the intense melody, he is like the protagonist of a cartoon who smiles confidently, even if he has nothing to show for it, even if he has countless enemies in front of him.",
	"725558": "...... so the moment I saw that, I was hooked.",
	"725559": "That's what I want to be.",
	"725560": "I want to be in that position.",
	"725561": "I want to be a solitary being who is applauded like a hero, but transcends even the applause, and who is lonely but does not need to indulge in sentimentality.",
	"725562": "So I made an effort to be a hero.",
	"725563": "Even though there is nothing specific about me.",
	"725564": "I don't have crazy dreams, I don't have marks anywhere on my body. No one has ever said to me, \"You are the chosen one,\" nor have I encountered any events that set me apart from others.",
	"725565": "But I chose to do my own thing.",
	"725566": "Believe that you are special.",
	"725567": "Even when I was with my classmates, I felt I had to reject such enjoyment even though I was having fun...... because that is a feeling that normal people have.",
	"725568": "In this way, he built high walls and created his own little kingdom.",
	"725569": "He joined the drama club and played the role of a hero.",
	"725570": "Dreaming that one day a light will shine from the heavens and a mysterious power will awaken.",
	"725571": "But ...... did it simply want to be a hero, or did it want to be a \"hero that people notice as a hero\"?",
	"725572": "I hadn't thought about that.",
	"725573": "Because vulgar analysis destroys the dream of \"heroes\".",
	"725574": "She is enamored with it despite her parents' anger, and stubbornly believes that she must have a mission different from others.",
	"725575": "...... That is the meaning of my life in this world.",
	"725576": "I didn't want to spend an ordinary lifetime. I didn't think that was my future, that there will always, always be a mission, and that one day such a day will come. ......",
	"725577": "I wished so every day.",
	"725578": "Until the age of 14.",
	"725580": "\"Lililin--\"",
	"725581": "The ringing of the phone woke me up from my dream and the scene of memories suddenly came to an end.",
	"725582": "I answered the phone and heard my boss's voice.",
	"725583": "Iron Master Issatsu!",
	"725584": "How long are you going to sleep for days and stay that way? I'm sure your injuries should have gotten better by now!",
	"725585": "Come to HQ as soon as possible. You haven't heard the last of the \"Care Project.\"",
	"725586": "Oh, yes--",
	"725587": "Before I could finish answering, the caller hung up on me.",
	"725588": "Oh, ...... means that the general meeting of the Human Contractors Federation is already over. Iron Master Issatsu's mission is over too.",
	"725589": "I looked around. Sunlight was illuminating the bed, but there was no one by my side. His leg was still in a cast. A basket of fruit lay by the bed. From the paper on it, it looked as if it had been delivered by his adoring wife.",
	"725590": "The cool air from the air conditioning system allowed us to enjoy cooler temperatures than we have had in a long time.",
	"725591": "Let's take a look at the thread: ...... Several documents are deadlining: ...... I need to get back to work soon.",
	"725592": "He put down the phone and changed his clothes. Tesshi Issatsu opened the door to his hospital room and walked limping out into the hot, humid air.",
	"725593": "Then he came to headquarters again.",
	"725594": "Although I could not see my reflection in the elevator glass that clearly, I could still easily see that I was exhausted.",
	"725595": "It is far from a face that does the job. Tesshi Issatsu thought so, and immediately decided to take out her compact and apply light makeup.",
	"725596": "However, the mirror of the compact was broken. He had no choice but to use the reflection of the glass to apply makeup. And she covered up her weak appearance that she showed Kyuushou with her makeup.",
	"725597": "The mission is over and we can forget about her.",
	"725598": "There is no room in a hero's symphony for an insignificant note like mine. The only things I deserve are work, claims processing, overtime, and all-nighters.",
	"725599": "Tesshi Issatsu told herself that, and opened her office door.",
	"725600": "This is Iron Master Issatsu.",
	"725601": "What are you doing coming in here with a cast on? You want me to feel sorry for you?",
	"725603": "Oh well.",
	"725604": "Iron Master Issatsu, Houraiji Kyuushou's work on this \"With the Sunlight: Postwar Special Person Care Project\" is complete.",
	"725605": "The second postwar general meeting of the board of directors of the Japan Federation of Bargaining Associations ended well.",
	"725606": "Congratulations. You made a mistake, but your last job at HQ has now been completed.",
	"725607": "Yes.",
	"725609": "...... last, work?",
	"725610": "That's right. Because the \"Care Project General Assembly Working Group\" was originally created by scraping together personnel from other departments at HQ.",
	"725611": "So once the General Assembly-related duties are over, all participants will return to their other departments.",
	"725612": "Unfortunately, however, it was decided at this general meeting to dismantle a significant portion of the headquarters organization in order to reduce the financial burden.",
	"725613": "The \"Internal Intelligence Section\" that you used to belong to has been included in that.",
	"725614": "The smile on his boss's face was hidden by a smile that told him it was a good feeling.",
	"725615": "At that moment, Kazumasa Tetsushi clenched his fist.",
	"725616": "Tesshi Issatsu noticed in the reflected light that the badge on his boss's chest had changed from before - the badge was more detailed and of a higher quality, giving the impression of a higher rank.",
	"725617": "I understand ....... So which department will you be working in from now on?",
	"725618": "The department itself is gone, and I can't find another department that will accept you. There is no place for you at headquarters.",
	"725619": "But ...... in recognition of all the hard work you've put in, I've found you a good place - you see, a post in charge of a branch office at the southern tip of the continent. The salary is 2.5 times the local level. How's that sound? That's a lot of money in this part of the world.",
	"725620": "...... You--you've been promoted on the merits of others and you're going to relegate me to the backwoods!",
	"725621": "Unable to restrain himself, Iron Master Issatsu finally raised his voice.",
	"725622": "This was the first time Tesshi Issatsu had so clearly expressed his anger.",
	"725623": "A look of surprise flashed across his boss's eyes for a moment. But soon, like a lion who has smelled the scent of blood, the boss smiled his best smile.",
	"725624": "How about ......, you guessed right. Yes, thanks to your efforts, Houraiji Kyuushou has responded that he is \"very satisfied\" with our work. I have been promoted to a high official.",
	"725625": "I've always thought ...... you were like a sponge or something, not reacting to any amount of abuse. But I guess that doesn't mean you can absorb it anywhere.",
	"725626": "Now that we're parting, it's a good time to tell you one thing - this guy you're talking about doesn't make solid eye contact when he meets people. You have two eyes, but they are unfocused or elusive. That's why I get so annoyed whenever I see you.",
	"725627": "That's why I'm here every day disciplining you in order to correct those habits.",
	"725628": "From now on, at best, I'll have to watch out for my own bad habits. And I don't know if my new boss is as merciful as I am. Hahaha!",
	"725629": "That's all. Take your business documents and get out of here right away - because where you're going is a wonderful land of grass and trees. If you don't like it, quit!",
	"725631": "Iron Master Issatsu left his office.",
	"725632": "Less than ten minutes after arriving at the office, Tetsushi Kazuka got on the elevator again in a daze. A blurry reflection of herself appeared on the transparent glass wall.",
	"725633": "I stared at my reflection.",
	"725634": "These eyes?",
	"725635": "Does this look in your eyes irritate people and make people think that you are someone they can insult?",
	"725636": "...... I see that you did.",
	"725637": "\"Clatter...\"",
	"725638": "Falling.",
	"725639": "The elevator falls down.",
	"725640": "Tesshi Issatsu also fell, along with her 14-year-old girlfriend.",
	"725641": "Back then, I was practicing every day for my \"hero\" plays. I felt I was shining on stage. Even if the story was made up and the world in which I performed was such a world, I was sure that there was some truth in it.",
	"725642": "-I believed that at the time.",
	"725643": "But the next month, when the drama club decided to do a play at a city event, my parents got mad.",
	"725644": "With his mid-term test scores in hand, his parents angrily asked him if he had been studying seriously lately, and if he was neglecting his studies because of his extracurricular activities. They told him to stop participating in such incomprehensible extracurricular activities and to concentrate on his schoolwork.",
	"725645": "She cried, argued, pleaded, and used every method she could think of, but ...... not only had no effect, she was thought to be too absorbed to see what was going on around her. Her parents forbade her to leave the house and told her, in an admonishing tone, that they would not allow her to go out.",
	"725646": "What we play in the theater is fictional. Such club activities are not good for the future at all. ......",
	"725647": "You think you're going to get into a prestigious university through theater? At your age, it's too late to pursue a career in the arts!\"",
	"725648": "\"Besides, college in the arts is a narrow gate ...... no matter how much you do as a hobbyist or amateur, the only people everyone respects in school are those with good grades! Just like when you go out into the world, only people with power and money are respected!\"",
	"725649": "At your age, the only thing you have to prove yourself is your grades!\"",
	"725650": "All of these words were vulgar.",
	"725651": "Iron Master Issatsu has eliminated them completely from his own ears.",
	"725652": "During the days she was grounded, she thought about the works of her \"heroes\" and took courage from imagining their fearlessness.",
	"725653": "Then, on the day of that heavy rain, she broke the lock on the window with a homemade tool and sneaked out of the house.",
	"725654": "It was raining heavily.",
	"725655": "But the heart of Iron Master Issatsu was very excited.",
	"725656": "She was drenched in rain, and besides, it was clear that her parents would be angry with her if she returned home, but her heart was racing in her blood. The act of escaping from the house after being forbidden to go out was the dream world of a novel, and she felt as if she had taken the first step toward becoming the hero of her own story.",
	"725657": "She ran to the theater club's practice field, soaking wet from the rain.",
	"725658": "But see .......",
	"725659": "The lead role she was originally supposed to play had already been taken by someone else.",
	"725660": "Why? What about me? What about me? This play was conceived by me!\"",
	"725661": "When questioned by Issatsu Tesshi, the student looked embarrassed.",
	"725662": "In the end, another student with whom she was somewhat friendly answered the question she posed.",
	"725663": "'Well, your parents came to me a few days ago and told me that Mr. Iron Master can no longer come to the drama club. But the play is coming up next month, and you can't perform without a lead role. So I went to .......\"",
	"725664": "I'm not a problem for ....... This is how I came. Let me do it so I can keep playing the lead role!\"",
	"725665": "Her friends and the rest of the club members looked at each other as she desperately asked for help. Their expressions were very stiff.",
	"725666": "How about, how should I put it, ......, have them take a look anyway?\"",
	"725667": "Tesshi Issatsu was told to wait by the child and watched for a while as the understudy performed.",
	"725668": "And--",
	"725669": "Anger, upset, and incredulity finally gave way to silence.",
	"725670": "Even though the play was written by me, the understudy was performing at a higher level than I was.",
	"725671": "His facial expressions and movements were many times more detailed than my own.",
	"725672": "-that was supposed to be my stage in my imagination.",
	"725673": "-That was supposed to be something only I could play, but that girl played it as if the \"hero\" was there more than I was.",
	"725674": "It was not only the child's performance on stage that struck down Iron Master Issatsu. It was also the way people looked at her other than Moukanon.",
	"725675": "That silent, questioning look, the one that asks her to shut up and step aside, the one that chokes out, \"Honey, do you realize how much practice time you are wasting on us?",
	"725676": "Iron Master Issatsu ran out onto the practice field.",
	"725677": "From that moment on, she knew that she would never be a \"hero\" or a leading lady.",
	"725678": "The stage itself may not have been made for you.",
	"725679": "Even if you climb on stage and raise your voice, in the end it will only be a cliché, a play that only you will be moved by.",
	"725680": "When the disappointed Tetsushi Kazuka returned home, her parents were strangely not angry with her. They made her ginger soup to prevent her from catching a cold and urged her to take a bath and change her clothes.",
	"725681": "The next day, Tetsushi Issatsu put all the novels, anime DVDs, and video games he had in a box and began to open his textbooks at his desk in his room.",
	"725682": "I gave up cosplaying at comic book fairs and stopped discussing anime stories with my friends. I closed the windows, didn't deal with the adoring chilly sounds that called out repeatedly under the house, and focused only on being better than others.",
	"725683": "As if baptized by the heavy rain, the iron master Issatsu's performance has been on the upswing ever since.",
	"725684": "At that time, the drama club's play also won first place in an event held by the city. Tesshi Kazumatsu also went to see the play, and the performance of the lead child impressed even Tesshi Kazumatsu.",
	"725685": "But that result of the drama club was presented only in the corner of the bulletin board near the school gate.",
	"725686": "Meanwhile, the names of several students, including Kazumasa Tetsushi, were most prominently featured on the bulletin board at the same time.",
	"725687": "It says: \"Our students, Mr. xxx and Ms. xxx ...... Tetsushi Kazuhatsu ...... they have achieved excellent results in this college entrance test. Congratulations.\" It was written.",
	"725688": "...... Is that what you meant?",
	"725689": "It was only then that I finally understood what my parents had meant.",
	"725690": "As if realizing the reality of the situation, Iron Master Issatsu then continued to walk higher and higher. However, sometimes she succeeded, and sometimes she failed. Despite the twists and turns, she graduated from a prestigious university and became a member of the headquarters of the Jinqiren. She was no longer a source of worry for her parents; she had become their proud daughter.",
	"725691": "The workplace of the ...... contractor was seen as very important and valuable to the parents. Little did the parents know the fact that they were actually working every day in the face of tremendous pressure.",
	"725692": "...... even though I am only the lowest enforcer and not at all proud of it.",
	"725693": "I have been enduring impatience and anxiety in my heart for a long time. ...... I can't take my anger out on others. I didn't want to do anything that would make people hate me.",
	"725694": "I have endured ...... all these years, I have pulled from myself all these years, I have obeyed all these years, I have suppressed my feelings all these years.",
	"725695": "Still, Iron Master Issatsu did not get what he wanted to get.",
	"725696": "All that the wingless ironmaster Issatsu could get was to fall in the end.",
	"725697": "Hotel in the morning. Iron Master Issatsu was organizing his luggage to check out by the prescribed time.",
	"725698": "Ichinatsu, how's work these days?",
	"725699": "It's the usual question.",
	"725700": "...... Yeah, fair enough.",
	"725701": "I'm glad to hear that. Mom, I've been worried about you living out there on your own and making sure you're doing okay. I was just thinking about when I should go clean up after you. ......",
	"725702": "When the call ended, more than ten minutes had passed.",
	"725703": "It was all meaningless. Because soon I would have to leave this town.",
	"725704": "I wonder what my ...... parents would look like if they knew I was being sent to a remote area from the headquarters of the Federation of People's Contractors.",
	"725705": "Huh. .......",
	"725706": "Who should we laugh at? Maybe it is you who should laugh the most.",
	"725707": "Let's go.",
	"725708": "As a loser, you just pack your bags and leave dejectedly with your \"assignment letter\" in hand.",
	"725709": "With this in mind, Iron Master Issatsu opened the door.",
	"725710": "Hello.",
	"725712": "Your leg injury hasn't healed yet, has it? Let's drive my car.",
	"725714": "In the car with me is a girl I know well this time. Outside the window, the wind is still screaming. The only difference from last time is that I am in the back seat and she is driving.",
	"725715": "Kyuushou discusses an interesting incident that occurred during a recent sightseeing trip.",
	"725716": "Tesshi Issatsu was receiving the news in the sky above as he watched planes take off and land at a distant airfield outside his window.",
	"725717": "Today, the day after the conference ended, there must have been many planes taking off with board members returning to their respective countries.",
	"725718": "Can I ask you one summer ............?",
	"725719": "Why do you have that look on your face?",
	"725720": "-a look that seems to be inhospitable, yet silently accepting of everything.",
	"725721": "Well ...... maybe that's because ...... I'm a loser.",
	"725722": "Loser?",
	"725723": "I couldn't be a responsible adult and be a hero for saving ...... people.",
	"725724": "I've been stuck at the ...... starting point for a long time, and whatever I do, something is missing.",
	"725725": "But this is how the life of an ordinary person is, isn't it? They have some kind of dissatisfaction and do something about it, but eventually they run into a new dissatisfaction, wander around lost, and repeatedly doubt themselves.",
	"725726": "Iron Master Issatsu said as if it was no big deal.",
	"725727": "The girl who heard her innermost words in the tunnel that day looked at her.",
	"725728": "Really?",
	"725729": "I do not think so.",
	"725730": "Ichinatsu, when was the last time you took a good look back at yourself? I don't know anyone like you say you do. It must be a delusion made up by someone who doesn't like you.",
	"725731": "What would you say to ............?",
	"725732": "The first day I met Issatsu, I thought he had a competitive spirit.",
	"725733": "I know those eyes well. It is the eye of someone who will not accept something and will stand for it. I know someone who has that look. I know one person who has that look in his eyes that says, \"The world doesn't have to be this way,\" and \"I'm going to change everything.",
	"725734": "The person accomplished it at the end of the day.",
	"725736": "My eyes suddenly met with my reflection in the rearview mirror of the car.",
	"725737": "I can't see clearly because the car is shaking. But I felt like I was looking at myself when I was 14 years old.",
	"725738": "You say, \"I'm convinced,\" but you're not convinced. They want to give up, but in the end they haven't been able to give up for a long time.",
	"725739": "These are the eyes of the girl on that heavy rainy day when she broke the lock on the window to sneak out and go to her stage in her ideal.",
	"725740": "Why .......",
	"725741": "For a moment, Iron Master Issatsu didn't understand why.",
	"725743": "The car stopped in the parking lot.",
	"725744": "The airport departure hall is just up ahead.",
	"725745": "It was time to say goodbye.",
	"725746": "One summer, we will meet again. Come visit this savior in Changkuo City anytime. I will show you around!",
	"725747": "Thank you for your hard work.",
	"725748": "There is a girl in front of you. Soon she will turn around and leave.",
	"725749": "...... Kyuushou.",
	"725750": "He stopped the girl.",
	"725751": "What's up?",
	"725752": "I'm sorry about what has happened so far at .......",
	"725753": "Initially, I was very rude to you.",
	"725754": "The girl looked at me strangely.",
	"725755": "Was it?",
	"725756": "Besides, isn't Issatsu ...... our friend already?",
	"725757": "Kyuushou smiled and waved at her.",
	"725758": "And with a feeling of rancor in his heart, Kazumasa Tesshi watched the girl disappear.",
	"725759": "...... Whew.",
	"725760": "Pulling his suitcase, Kazumasa Tetsushi made his way to the boarding gate.",
	"725762": "The boarding area was crowded and noisy.",
	"725763": "But there is no need to panic, as there are still two hours until departure time.",
	"725764": "So I headed to the ladies room to avoid the crowds.",
	"725765": "I saw myself in the mirror.",
	"725766": "I stared at it.",
	"725768": "It was this look. It was the look that made Kyuushou feel that he was \"unyielding.",
	"725769": "Don't tell me I haven't given up yet?",
	"725770": "Are you saying that you didn't like seeing this eye in the eyes of that shameless, nasty person who would do anything to get ahead?",
	"725771": "Somewhere in the back of my mind, I realized that I was strangely certain of that.",
	"725772": "I wonder how long it has been since ...... already.",
	"725773": "...... I think we can sort out how we felt at that time now.",
	"725774": "I asked myself that question in the mirror.",
	"725775": "I felt as if my self in the mirror despised me for asking such a question.",
	"725776": "The iron master Issatsu feared that disdain. The fear felt as if it was overflowing from deep within, from some kind of essence. It was as if the levee that my parents, myself, and my social life had built up over the years had burst.",
	"725777": "Iron Master Issatsu turned off the faucet and walked out of the bathroom.",
	"725778": "The area was still crowded and very noisy.",
	"725779": "My phone rang. It was my mother calling.",
	"725780": "Not wanting to talk about anything now, he switched his phone to silent mode.",
	"725781": "I looked back and saw the intense sunlight shining through the large window panes in the departure area. The only shadows in the situation were quite a distance away.",
	"725782": "Perhaps because the airport was crowded, it was hot and humid even though it was indoors.",
	"725783": "\"Hey, look at that--\"",
	"725784": "A person walking with a suitcase in tow pointed out the window and said so. But it was none of Iron Master Issatsu's business.",
	"725785": "Find an available chair at .......",
	"725786": "I made my way through the crowd and finally sat down. The person next to me in that chair also seemed to be looking out the window.",
	"725787": "......? Are you saying that there is something so unusual outside your window?",
	"725788": "Curious, Tesshi Kazumatsu also looked out the window.",
	"725789": ".......",
	"725790": "The view was the same as usual. If there is anything odd about it, those clouds just seem a little ...... too big?",
	"725791": "Or, no way, right? But by any chance: ----",
	"725792": "The words that followed were replaced by mute surprise.",
	"725793": "I heard a panicked voice from a distance behind me. It was a familiar voice.",
	"725794": "Issatsu--get down!",
	"725795": "What?",
	"725796": "At that moment, Iron Master Issatsu understood everything.",
	"725797": "Those are not clouds.",
	"725798": "Battleships.",
	"725799": "Doodle-doodle-doodle-doodle!\"",
	"725800": "They swept in.",
	"725801": "The boarding area, which had been full of people's noisy voices just a few moments earlier, was instantly filled with bloodcurdling screams.",
	"725802": "Soldiers dressed in uniforms that I had seen somewhere before rushed in one after another. With weapons in their hands, they mercilessly took people's lives.",
	"725803": "Iron Master Issatsu had no choice but to move forward with the flow of people, bumping into people as he went. Confusion and surprise filled her mind.",
	"725804": "What the heck happened to ......?",
	"725805": "...... Why is this happening all of a sudden?",
	"725806": "The soldiers shot and killed airport security guards one after another. Then they executed passengers who were trying to escape from the departure area. A man who appeared to be a superior officer leading the soldiers climbed to the top of the stairs and was speaking over a loudspeaker.",
	"725807": "Kyuushou, who had told me to get down earlier, was pushed out of sight by the crowd. The plane, which was preparing to take off, was ablaze with flames.",
	"725808": "Flames. .......",
	"725809": "Besides the flames, there was a huge battleship floating in the air outside. It looked like a monster that was devouring all life, or like a nest that was constantly producing insects. Countless soldiers were emerging from it one after another.",
	"725810": "That figure is ...... no matter how you look at it.",
	"725811": "Yes, it is. Isn't this battleship the missing battleship \"Yamanza\"?",
	"725812": "Is this real? .......",
	"725813": "Am I having a bad dream?",
	"725814": "Iron Master Issatsu was stunned and looked around him.",
	"725815": "The commanders standing at the highest point were reading out their declarations to the dozens of drone cameras floating in the air, and the words were heard by Iron Master Kazumasa.",
	"725816": "\"...... We are the Humanity Innovation Liberation Front. We impose sanctions against directors who are full of lies and true traitors to their country. We also demand their release. They are being detained at .......\"",
	"725817": "That uniform ...... is the same as the design of the Human Contractors Federation, only the color is different .......",
	"725818": "...... Wake up, my brothers and sisters. The League of Mankind is not a forum for equal dialogue among all mankind, even though it calls itself the League of Mankind. The League of Mankind Covenant is just a tool to interfere with the freedom of those in weak areas. ......",
	"725819": "It's truly politics of fear. ...... I wonder if you are referring to the little girl crying over there, being held by her mother. ...... or the young man lying beside her. ...... or the young man? Or the young man lying beside her, ...... who looks like the father of the child?",
	"725820": "Stay quiet.",
	"725821": "The soldier hit the ground with his gun, but instead of stopping the girl from crying, she cried even harder.",
	"725822": "Iron Master Issatsu watched the scene in a daze. His mind was empty. It was as if she was thinking of nothing.",
	"725823": "I could not feel the reality of everything that was happening in front of me.",
	"725824": "It felt like an imaginary image or something woven of light and shadow.",
	"725825": "Why ...... did this ...... happen?",
	"725826": "What good are the more than 10,000 reports issued by the office of the Federation of Human Contractors in response to the disaster of the Honkai of ......? Mr. Chairman, members of Congress, have any of you ever been aboard a battleship, the Moonlight Throne, and pulled the trigger of a weapon even once?\"",
	"725827": "What in the world have these noble directors done for us in the face of frequent global food crises and natural disasters? They are just dodging empty theories on the table in front of mountains of data. This world needs a leader. We need a hero of Honkai.",
	"725828": "The girl continues to cry. She is trying to escape from her mother who is holding her and go towards the man lying on the ground.",
	"725829": "The woman holding the girl had blue streaks floating on her hands. Tears were streaming down from her bright red eyes. But still she continued to hold her daughter tightly.",
	"725830": "Pa...... papa.......\"",
	"725831": "\"...... don't move! I have to stay here!\"",
	"725832": "You guys be quiet! Wait--\"",
	"725833": "The soldier seemed to notice something. The look in his eyes became even more stern.",
	"725834": "You are the secretary of the third director of the Federation of People's Contractors. Where did the third director go!",
	"725835": "I don't know ......!\"",
	"725836": "I watched the whole exchange in silence. And I listened to their lines.",
	"725837": "The bad guys, and the lines of the innocent.",
	"725838": "Those lines were like a script for a stage play.",
	"725839": "Bad people do bad things and good people have a hard time. Then a hero appears and saves the people.",
	"725840": "The bad people on this stage today can only be described as unfortunate.",
	"725841": "Because the most powerful heroes in this world are here by a bit of a coincidence. ......",
	"725842": "--Heroes are those who happen to be on the scene due to a variety of factors.",
	"725843": "The talk of the conductor was still going on.",
	"725844": "Please believe me when I say, \"....... Our actions today are not terrorism. They are necessary for the future of humanity. People around the world who are watching this, please believe .......\"",
	"725845": "Soldiers caught the woman.",
	"725846": "Say, where's the third board member!\"",
	"725847": "I don't know. I really don't know. ...... Director has long gone away!\"",
	"725848": "\"Ugh ...... mama ...... mama ...... mama let go of me .......\"",
	"725849": "We were silent, watching the scene and waiting for the curtain to open. I waited for the hero to emerge from the sky using a wire.",
	"725850": "Don't lie to me. You're a secretary. How could I not know where the board members are going?",
	"725851": "I heard the sound of bullets being loaded, a \"click.\" It was like the music had started conducting. Hero, hurry up and appear. It's too late to start playing!",
	"725852": "You said, \"...... enough already. In any case, you've probably been a secretary, too, and you've had a sweet deal for many years. Then you have committed a mortal sin. You were born that way.\"",
	"725853": "\"...... you, and your daughter too ...... turn around.\"",
	"725854": "I watched the scene in silence.",
	"725855": "\"...... Stop!\"",
	"725856": "\"Ugh ...... mom .......\"",
	"725857": "I watched the scene in silence.",
	"725858": "I wasn't a hero to begin with.",
	"725859": "Originally all along.",
	"725860": "The fantasy world has long since been shattered and messed up.",
	"725861": "Because I am an ordinary person with no Stigmata, no Honkai energy, and no possibility of climbing the stage.",
	"725862": "Because I am just one of the spectators looking up at the brilliant performance from below the stage.",
	"725863": "It's good to have that kind of life,\" he said. Ordinary life has its own charm.\" Some might say.",
	"725864": "However, once they see the possibility of flight, they cannot continue to stay on the ground.",
	"725865": "What no one knows is that when I was 14, I went to see a story about a hero played by someone who took the stage in my place.",
	"725866": "When she finished her performance at ...... that time, the thousands of people in the audience all applauded and honored her themselves. She was the only thing people saw on the lit-up stage. She had a beauty that moved people's hearts.",
	"725867": "......It was very frustrating.",
	"725868": "...... It may have been a very brief moment in time, but it was a moment I had not stopped pursuing.",
	"725869": "The prominent place on the ...... bulletin board was about my improved grades, but what I kept staring at was the picture of that play in the lower right hand corner.",
	"725870": "......At no time since then have I been able to get the lights of that night and the glorious stage out of my head.",
	"725871": "So after meeting the girl on stage again, I never thought of her as an intercepted karma pusher or anything like that. Many people don't pay any attention to them when they pass by the reception desk, but I always want to talk to her. I always want to talk to her because I always feel that she has something that I don't have.",
	"725872": "She says she is jealous of me, but she may not know that I am also very jealous of her ...... being able to shine on stage as a leading lady.",
	"725873": "It is something that I can never reach by myself, no matter how I try.",
	"725874": "...... does not deserve to be the star of the show.",
	"725875": "...... does not deserve to be a hero.",
	"725876": "Even if it was on a false stage.",
	"725877": "There is no possibility of that.",
	"725878": "So all along, I told myself that I had to get rid of those trivial illusions, I had to get rid of them.",
	"725879": "...... that we have to stop trying to be heroes.",
	"725880": "But you can also visit .......",
	"725881": "Why .......",
	"725882": "You can visit ...... at times like this.",
	"725883": "...... body moves on its own, doesn't it?",
	"725884": "The moment the gun was held up, my body was moving on its own.",
	"725885": "He hit the soldier from behind with all his might, and the soldier fell.",
	"725887": "Why are you making a faint sound?",
	"725888": "Why are there tears all over your face?",
	"725889": "Don't you still have the spirit of a hero in you?",
	"725890": "But ...... doesn't care about that.",
	"725891": "Facing the flowing fresh blood, Tesshi Issatsu realized. That hero may indeed save the world. But he cannot save all people one by one. That is why a second hero is needed on the stage.",
	"725892": "She drew her sword.",
	"725893": "Where did you get a sword from?",
	"725894": "Oh, this was just an umbrella. An umbrella given to me by Mr. Ado.",
	"725895": "It was a long umbrella, not a folding one. But the part that holds it looks like a sword handle, and on the handle is engraved in distorted characters the name of the sword that Mo-san had worn in junior high school.",
	"725896": "When folded, the umbrella looked like a sword ...... No, this is a sword.",
	"725897": "It's a sword that doesn't meet the standard. But for a hero who doesn't meet the standard, ...... is just fine.",
	"725898": "Ugh--you--!",
	"725899": "He held the pointy end of the umbrella to his throat.",
	"725900": "Hmm, so that's what happened. I wonder why it hasn't been broken all this time.",
	"725901": "Because it was for today.",
	"725902": "A woman held her daughter in her arms. Her face was a mixture of fear and gratitude.",
	"725903": "Thank you.\" You can reach us at .......\"",
	"725904": "Don't worry about that. Just get out of here--",
	"725905": "Quickly notice. A true hero -- notice quickly --!",
	"725906": "Contrary to my expectations, a few soldiers, perhaps sensing the situation, ran up to me and tried to raise their guns - and they did.",
	"725908": "I gritted my teeth and tried to shield the parent and child.",
	"725909": "He then hugged them both tightly.",
	"725910": "Knowing that there is no point in doing such a thing.",
	"725911": "The actions and reactions were something I did without thinking at all in my ...... head.",
	"725912": "(...... will I die here?)",
	"725913": "But the expected gunfire was not heard.",
	"725914": "What I felt instead was a violent shaking of the ground.",
	"725915": "I looked up in surprise, protecting them, and saw a situation that I will never forget - a situation that was spread out before me - a situation that I will never forget.",
	"725916": "Outside, the battleship \"Yamanza\" crumpled as if crushed by a giant invisible hand, and the battleship's framework gradually deformed. The giant steel monster turned into scrap metal.",
	"725917": "The flat ground was also deformed by many cracks. The roof of the domed boarding area slowly cracked open, and the commander, who was standing on a high place, stared up at the cracking ceiling and saw a figure there.",
	"725918": "--it was Kyuushou.",
	"725919": "The mess you've made...",
	"725920": "Let this Houraiji Kurosawa-sama pull back the curtain!\"",
	"725922": "The soldiers were destroyed and order was restored in the boarding area. However, since the airport was no longer functioning properly, people who had planned to board left the airport one by one and scattered to various parts of the city.",
	"725923": "Outside the airport.",
	"725924": "Ichinatsu, were you ok? ...... I'm glad Ichinatsu didn't get hurt in that mess.",
	"725925": "I had to know exactly where the enemy was beforehand, so I didn't get to it right away,...... because otherwise the destruction would have been extensive.",
	"725926": "Kyuushou said apologetically.",
	"725927": "...... I know.",
	"725928": "Suddenly I heard a voice behind me.",
	"725929": "Sis. ...... sis. .......\"",
	"725930": "It was the woman and her daughter from earlier.",
	"725931": "Thank you for what you just said. I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't been there. Hurry up and thank your sister at .......\"",
	"725932": "Oh, um, thanks for the ...... sister .......\"",
	"725934": "--Heroes are those who happen to be on the scene due to a variety of factors.",
	"725935": "The woman and her daughter thanked Tetsushi Kazumasa with red eyes and asked if he could come to their house. When I politely declined, the woman and her daughter said their goodbyes and left.",
	"725936": "Kyuushou, who was nearby, watched them with interest. When they left, he said the following.",
	"725937": "Did Issatsu help those two?",
	"725938": "...... Well, you could say that.",
	"725939": "I see. Huh.",
	"725940": "Something funny?",
	"725941": "No, it's nothing. It's just that you seemed to be in better spirits than before, even after what happened earlier.",
	"725942": "The airport has been pretty much destroyed and the summer flights will probably be postponed for a while.",
	"725943": "Don't worry about that.",
	"725944": "Because there is no more reason to fly anymore.",
	"725945": "Kyuushou looked unsure.",
	"725946": "However, looking into the eyes of Iron Master Issatsu, the color of doubt gradually faded from Kyuushou's face.",
	"725947": "...... mind has been unleashed, hasn't it?",
	"725948": "No. ......I should say that I have made peace with my true self.",
	"725949": "Tesshi Issatsu took a document from his suitcase and rolled it up into a cylinder.",
	"725950": "I have someplace I have to go now.",
	"725951": "Human Contractors Federation Headquarters Building.",
	"725952": "It began to rain.",
	"725953": "Nice rain.",
	"725954": "Iron Master Issatsu was fed up with this sweltering heat. But now she was no longer going to keep enduring it. This sky would be equally fed up and would try to baptize her for her.",
	"725955": "How many times have we been here?",
	"725956": "One thing is clear: I feel different now than I did when I came here in the past.",
	"725957": "Standing in front of a building, looking out at the towering structure, she called someone.",
	"725958": "Hello, Issatsu. You .......",
	"725959": "Before my mother could finish her words, Issatsu Tesshi had begun to speak.",
	"725960": "Something that had been lodged deep within me for a long time.",
	"725961": "Something I've been wanting to say for a long time.",
	"725962": "......Mom. I'm going to quit my job at the Human Contractors Federation headquarters. I may study theater again in the future, or I may go to an animation production company to create fantastic stories like soap bubbles.",
	"725963": "And I don't want to get married - I'm not going to get married for the rest of my life. So from now on, I don't need to look for a blind date or anything.",
	"725964": "He then immediately hung up the phone and turned it off.",
	"725965": "Later, stepping in a puddle, Iron Master Issatsu strode with a refreshing breeze into the Jin Qi Ren building.",
	"725966": "Somewhat unfortunately, I did not see Mr. Moo at the reception desk.",
	"725967": "(I wanted to talk to you for a minute, but you can call me after you leave here.)",
	"725968": "As I was thinking about this, I arrived at a floor I had frequented in the past. As I opened the office door, I saw the face of that person.",
	"725969": "...... you .......",
	"725970": "His expression changed from surprise to anger in an instant.",
	"725971": "Iron Master Issatsu ...... what are you doing here! I told you. There is no place for you at HQ anymore!",
	"725972": "I know that.",
	"725973": "This may be the first time I've ever smiled in front of this guy.",
	"725974": "Tesshi Issatsu clutched the papers rolled into a cylinder and punched his boss in the face as hard as he could.",
	"725975": "Then, without giving him a chance to fight back, he kicked his boss in the leg as hard as he could.",
	"725976": "Idiots like you ...... have been wanting to do this for a long time!",
	"725977": "I'm quitting today!",
	"725978": "An unstoppable scream sounded from behind him. Tesshi Issatsu opened the door with amusement and left the office.",
	"725980": "After a few jabs of cold water on my face, I felt the muggy heat finally ease.",
	"725981": "I can still see the uncontrollable laughter on his face in the mirror.",
	"725982": "This is what my smile looked like when I laughed from the heart. ......",
	"725983": "Iron Master Issatsu winked.",
	"725984": "...... Try to laugh a lot more in the future.",
	"725985": "She smiled.",
	"725986": "He smiled happily.",
	"725987": "After a while, I left the bathroom.",
	"725988": "What shall we do tomorrow?",
	"725989": "Tata. .......",
	"725990": "I think I'll play with adore-san first.",
	"725991": "Tattoo ...... Tattoo .............",
	"725992": "And I'll talk to her about what to do in the future. I'll also ask Kyuushou about it.",
	"725993": "Kyuushou has helped me a lot and I hope I can do something for ...... her.",
	"725994": "Tontonton!",
	"725996": "Oh, I must be feeling so much better mentally now, right?",
	"725997": "I quit my job and got enough rest at the hospital.",
	"725998": "But why do I still hear that auditory hallucination?",
	"725999": ".................. Maybe this isn't a hallucination?",
	"726000": "So who the hell is knocking on ...... this then?",
	"726001": "...... decided.",
	"726002": "It's my last day at Jin Qi Ren anyway, and it would be a shame not to go and see what this sound is all about.",
	"726003": "With that in mind, I decided to follow the footsteps. As I had done that night, I decided to follow the footsteps to see who was trying to surprise me.",
	"726004": "Let's go.",
	"726006": "Nothing but ......?",
	"726008": "Is it here?",
	"726010": "No one was there.",
	"726011": "But the footsteps still continued.",
	"726012": "Where are they coming from? From what I hear, it sounds like footsteps without shoes, but who in the world is walking without shoes in Jin Qi Ren?",
	"726013": "And from the sound of it, it's like it's waiting for me to follow.",
	"726014": "Excuse me--who are you? Do you need any help?",
	"726016": "Sound gone?",
	"726017": "Tattoo .................. Tattoo ......... ....",
	"726018": "Again. But this time it sounds like it's coming from the other side of the wall .......",
	"726019": "Iron Master Issatsu approached the wall and listened carefully.",
	"726020": "This guy sure looks like he's walking without shoes ...... and moving along the wall to ...... up?",
	"726021": "The direction of the sound changed and this time it came from directly above the Iron Master Issatsu's .......",
	"726022": ".................. is this ...... the sound of rebar in a wall breaking?",
	"726023": "Otherwise it would be inexplicable, wouldn't it? Are you saying that someone is moving around stuck to the exterior walls of a human contractor's building? But what do you mean that they can transmit sound inside a soundproofed building, blend into the walls, and even go up?",
	"726024": "Tontonton!",
	"726026": "Tontontontontontontontontontontontontontontontontontontontontontontontontontontontonton!",
	"726027": "It was as if that someone had invited me.",
	"726028": ".................. gocry .......",
	"726029": "I swallowed my spit.",
	"726030": "Iron Master Issatsu can be found at .......",
	"726031": "Leave the room.",
	"726032": "I climbed the stairs.",
	"726033": "Then we got to the room where the sound was coming from.",
	"726034": "The door is half-open, as if leading one inside.",
	"726035": "Gui...... b.......",
	"726036": "I heard someone sitting in a chair from inside the room.",
	"726037": "Taking a deep breath once, Tesshi Issatsu walked into the room.",
	"726039": "In a room with no set access restrictions by rank, there is a desk, a chair, and a single computer.",
	"726040": "There was no one sitting in the chair and nothing on it. And the area was slightly illuminated by the light from the computer screen.",
	"726041": "Does this mean ...... me to sit in the chair ......?",
	"726042": "I was scared. Tesshi Issatsu's heart was filled with indescribable fear.",
	"726043": "But it was not due to fear of this eerie event, but to a strange intuition.",
	"726044": "The Iron Master Issatsu's intuition was in this computer--",
	"726045": "It was telling her that there were things she should not ............ see, but that she would eventually see.",
	"726046": "Iron Master Issatsu sat down in a chair.",
	"726050": ".............................. .............................. ............ \"Moon Hiding Project\"?",
	"726051": "Suddenly, an alarm sounded throughout the headquarters building.",
	"726053": "It has become real. What I feared has become reality.",
	"726054": "Iron Master Issatsu immediately got up and headed for the elevator at full speed, got in, and pressed the button for the floor below.",
	"726055": "Iron Master Issatsu should not have seen that.",
	"726056": "But she had no choice but to watch. She wanted to help. This is the building of Jinki-ren, the Federation of Human Contracts. The secrets here are closely connected to the world.",
	"726057": "And with that hero.",
	"726058": "Oh ...... I see ...... that's what it was - Kyuushou's visit to New York wasn't just a trip.",
	"726059": "That means you must ....... I have to let her know.",
	"726060": "I need to tell Kyuushou about this at ......!",
	"726061": "The elevator headed down at its usual speed as the alarm sounded.",
	"726062": "I turned on my phone screen in the elevator, but it was out of range.",
	"726063": "100, 99, 98. ......",
	"726064": "The change in the numbers was strangely consistent with the rate at which his heart was pulsing.",
	"726065": "Like this heartbeat, the numbers are changing fast. ...... Don't stop, don't stop, keep going--",
	"726066": "The elevator stopped.",
	"726067": "6th floor.",
	"726068": "The door opened.",
	"726069": "A deathly presence stood before me. They wore the uniform of the Jinki-ren.",
	"726070": "What am I going to do? Why don't I have anything or any means to counteract them at such an important time?",
	"726071": "However, contrary to my expectations, they looked at Kazumatsu Tesshi for a moment, then turned their gazes elsewhere as if they were not interested in anything, and got into the elevator.",
	"726072": "She recalled that she was still wearing her badge from the Human Contractors Federation headquarters.",
	"726073": "(That's what I'm talking about. .......)",
	"726074": "(...... Don't worry, they haven't noticed.)",
	"726075": "Is it under that ......?",
	"726076": "It's no wonder.",
	"726077": "I asked something stupid. Why did I make unnecessary conversation to get their attention?",
	"726078": "But fortunately, you haven't been viewed with suspicion yet. ......",
	"726079": "Get to the lower level quickly. Quickly ...... quickly ...... quickly ...... quickly.",
	"726080": "5th floor. ...................",
	"726081": "passed.",
	"726082": "4th floor. .........................",
	"726083": "passed.",
	"726084": "3rd floor. .........................",
	"726085": "Chin.",
	"726086": "Stopped.",
	"726087": "The door opened.",
	"726088": "Oh, Kazumasa!",
	"726089": "Mr. Ado ......?",
	"726090": "I came to get some paper from the printer. Oh, by the way, the alarm went off earlier, didn't it?",
	"726091": "Moochangone pointed toward the printing room.",
	"726092": "That's right. .......",
	"726093": "I'm on this floor, so I'll see you later.",
	"726094": "Oh, .......",
	"726095": "Iron Master Issatsu exhaled in relief.",
	"726096": "I can't stand this Russian roulette feeling anymore. Let's take the stairs down.",
	"726097": "I felt the fear going around my whole body like a poison, but Kazumasa Tetsushi managed to squeeze out the last remaining calmness in his body. Don't shake. Don't run. Don't let ...... know that I'm suspicious.",
	"726098": "............ so don't look back.",
	"726099": "Okay, we've come this far.",
	"726100": "We came to the side of the stairs.",
	"726101": "Now I can finally rest easy.",
	"726102": "If only we could get out of the building. ......",
	"726103": "He stepped forward.",
	"726104": "When I touched the handrail of the staircase, I felt a chill.",
	"726105": "Then, Issatsu Tesshi realized something important.",
	"726106": "Oh no, we have to run and get out of here. ----",
	"726107": "Pan pan pan! ----",
	"726108": "Ah.",
	"726109": "Iron Master Issatsu's vision suddenly gapped downward, then back up again.",
	"726110": "She soon realized that she had been shot in the leg.",
	"726111": "Just before she was struck, she realized that she had made a mistake, a mistake that could only be described as stupid.",
	"726112": "Originally, she was the only one in the elevator, and although she got off the elevator saying she had business on the third floor, she did not press the button for the third floor.",
	"726113": "The marble floor loomed over my face.",
	"726114": "Then she rolled off the top of the stairs.",
	"726115": "He hit the hard floor hard and felt the cold and pain of the floor.",
	"726116": "Still, it rolled on down without stopping.",
	"726117": "Tesshi Issatsu's body no longer had the strength left to support or balance herself, and she tumbled down the stairs.",
	"726118": "I hit the sharp edge of the staircase and felt the cold and almost stopped breathing.",
	"726119": "But even then, it wasn't over. She was not going to let it end there.",
	"726120": "I have to go to Houraiji Kyuushou. I have to tell her everything. Tesshi Issatsu knew that ...... Tesshi Issatsu knew that feeling of hers.",
	"726121": "My chest became painful, my bones broke, cracked, and I felt cold.",
	"726122": "Iron Master Issatsu was finally able to stop himself from falling. No, maybe there was nowhere else to fall. In front of me was another floor, the exit.",
	"726123": "Before I knew it, the rain had stopped and bright sunshine was shining around.",
	"726124": "Sunlight shone through the glass doors, illuminating the floor in a golden color.",
	"726125": "It was like a golden dream world.",
	"726126": "I hurried ...... ahead toward there.",
	"726127": "\"Pan-pan, pan.\"",
	"726128": "Has something covered your eyes?",
	"726129": "My eyes blurred and I lost strength. I felt something flow through me and turn cold.",
	"726130": "Iron Master Issatsu knew what he had been aiming for all along.",
	"726131": "I lost strength, felt weight, pain and cold.",
	"726132": "Iron Master Issatsu knew that he had always wanted to be a hero.",
	"726133": "Since that is the case, ...... I absolutely must go to \"that place\" .......",
	"726134": "The last step was not reached.",
	"726135": "I felt paralyzed, chaotic, dark, and cold.",
	"726136": "Absolutely .......",
	"726137": "Pan!\"",
	"726139": "Cold.",
	"726140": "And finally, the only thing that ...... Iron Master Issatsu could feel was coldness.",
	"726696": "According to textbooks, there have been brief periods of peace in human history.",
	"726697": "A period of peace does not mean that there was no conflict at all among the human race, until the global \"will-overlord\" disappeared--and then the \"will-overlord\" was gone.",
	"726698": "No major conflicts among humans occurred.",
	"726699": "However, the films of the time depicted a conflict between aliens, subterraneans, and people of the future, and humankind.",
	"726700": "And, knowing that the concept of confrontation existed, he single-mindedly believed that a global war would never break out.",
	"726701": "Back then, I could not understand how they could have such wild ideas. How could they not know that conflict is something that has existed universally throughout history?",
	"726702": "But now that I think about it, it was in a way immature of me to have such a viewpoint, living in that era.",
	"726703": "People live in history, but most people are not aware of this for the most part.",
	"726704": "We perceive all the things that we have come to see in the course of our own development as the natural state of affairs in the operation of the world... and we are not able to see the world as it is.",
	"726705": "They are unaware that the world is in the midst of change.",
	"726706": "The age has died out.",
	"726707": "And birth--",
	"726708": "The heroes who once saved the world opened not a volume - but a page of a new era.",
	"726710": "You may be curious to know how the story then turned out.",
	"726711": "But I want you to stop for a while here without panicking.",
	"726712": "I will tell you what I have actually seen with my own eyes.",
	"726713": "I, who am not the hero of the story, think about how that era died out.",
	"726714": "How did the new order come into being?",
	"726715": "Goho-goho ...... goho-goho ...... goho-goho ...... goho-goho ...... goho-goho.",
	"726716": "......The night is over.",
	"726717": "The sunlight shone through the window onto the bed, waking the woman who was lying there. Her breasts were rising and falling, and her insides were phlegmatic, making a sound like the roar of a wild beast.",
	"726719": "I'm up.",
	"726720": "Go to ...... gohgoho .......",

	"726734": "Boom-boom! Boom-boom!",
	"726735": "Yes, machine repair?",
	"726736": "This TV stopped working yesterday. If things continue like this, I won't be able to keep up with my work at the screening hall.",
	"726737": "Please wait a moment.",
	"726738": "Bang bang!",
	"726739": "Fixed.",
	"726740": "Oh! It's just as they say, isn't it? You can really fix a machine just by tapping on it.",
	"726741": "Thank you for your request. The cost will be for 2 military bullets.",
	"726742": "Huh? Are you serious? I just slapped you and you think I'm ripping you off?",
	"726743": "...... If you can fix it yourself, why did you ask me to do it?",
	"726744": "Huh. I just wanted to see if the rumors were true. Here, take these homemade bullets. Take it with you.",
	"726745": "Thank you very much.",
	"726746": "\"Ha ha ha, did you fall down? Watch out for your surroundings.\"",
	"726747": "...... Phew, I'm glad I didn't lose my bullets.",

	"726757": "Your next door neighbor, they found him the other day, he had been dead for a week already.\"",
	"726758": "When are the armies coming? Well, I don't care which army. I don't care who wins the civil war.\"",
	"726759": "What's the point of all that thinking?",
	"726760": "A silent world, a corrupt sky, a child in ashes.",
	"726761": "Excuse me, Mr. Victor.",
	"726762": "Mr. Victor, ...... are you calling for me?",
	"726763": "There is no one who can stand against Victor in this shelter. He has a lot of supplies and 30 rifles. He is also very efficient and does not like to answer in a roundabout way.",
	"726764": "I knew that, but still my words to him became somewhat choked up.",
	"726765": "Sir. She is, as you know, the only repairman in this base.",
	"726766": "Although she is only 16 years old, her methods have a very ...... mysterious power.",
	"726767": "Is Victor's attitude strange because he has an eccentric woman by his side?",
	"726768": "The woman was sitting posturely with her back to Popo, listening to Victor's explanation.",
	"726769": "Her?",
	"726770": "Ha, yes. I am a repairman .......",
	"726771": "If you imagine a person emerging from a steel hell, with chainsaws and welding machines attacking him, you will surely imagine this kind of person.",
	"726772": "While Victor was introducing Popo, the woman made not the slightest move or even a sign that she was listening to him.",
	"726773": "Victor, on the other hand, was slightly bent forward to explain carefully.",
	"726774": "Miss, take this.",
	"726775": "Oh--! Is this ......?",
	"726776": "The eccentric woman, clad in armor, suddenly tossed her rifle at Popo. Although she hugged him quickly, Popo's shoulders jumped a little in surprise.",
	"726777": "It was an old rifle, perhaps a modified Type 07. It appeared to be one that could be loaded with Honkai energy and driven by the power of the holy grail.",
	"726778": "The ability to use weapons driven by the power of the Stigmata means that ...... this woman is either a Stigmata user or--",
	"726779": "Ugh--",
	"726780": "Victor grabbed Popo by the ear and pulled him in front of the woman.",
	"726781": "What are you doing so far away? What do you think? Can you fix this?",
	"726782": "Well, I think--",
	"726783": "Shut up and let them do it.",
	"726784": "Damn, you go to Sumiko or something.",
	"726785": "Yes.",
	"726786": "First, there's the network. Can you connect to the internet here? Any format is fine, and I'll play the price.",
	"726787": "Sorry. I can't make the connection here. Look, it's such a short distance from there.",
	"726788": "Victor pointed out the window.",
	"726789": "You don't need to see it. He is pointing to an eroded and stagnant sky.",
	"726790": "About six months ago, the long-running Great War - and the daily lives of all those around me - were shattered in a fragile way by this wave of desperate Honkai.",
	"726791": "It kept spreading, forcing us to evacuate repeatedly. Eventually we lost all access to new information and were trapped on an island, barely surviving.",
	"726792": "Cracks in the Honkai. ...... That's not too much to ask.",
	"726793": "I heard it was by the First Corps. ...... Is it true?",
	"726794": "That information is going to cost you money too. How much are you willing to pay?",
	"726795": "No, thank you. I am just a middle-aged man with a passion for community service, and war and peace have nothing to do with me. Please forgive me if I am rude.",
	"726796": "If you can't even connect to the internet, then you are useless for anything except repairing weapons.",
	"726797": "Please do not jump to conclusions so quickly. While our repairman is looking at your weapons, why don't you take a look at our warehouse? We may have just what you need to replenish.",
	"726798": "(What the hell is this guy ......)",
	"726799": "Popo was in the corner checking the status of the 07 formula and listening to their conversation.",
	"726800": "Victor was very careful, as if he were handling a bomb, in dealing with this eccentric guest. He opened the back door and pulled out an old wheelbarrow. The wheelbarrow was loaded with a variety of shiny, polished items.",
	"726801": "Weapons, ammunition, and explosives...... I'm sure that if you are as powerful as His Excellency, you would never look at a live weapon, but you never know when the unexpected may happen. I think it is better to have some old-fashioned weapons that you are familiar with just in case something happens.",
	"726802": "Oh, and of course there is medicine. If you are not a sacristan, you are still more or less subject to the erosion of Honkai. And even a sacristan can be injured from time to time, so it is difficult without medicine.",
	"726803": "Medicine......",
	"726804": "The \"Type II Honkai Erosion Inhibitor\" of the Hippocrates Group of the Eastern Legion should be in red packaging.",
	"726805": "Hey Popo, you focus on that gun. If you can fix that, His Excellency will reward you.",
	"726806": "Yes.",
	"726807": "Is she still a sacramental user? But the object she is holding is a base for an implanted body, which is not necessary for a sacramental user. -A closer look reveals that it looks a little different from a general-purpose substratum.",
	"726808": "Anyway, let's see if we can fix it.",
	"726809": "Bang bang!",
	"726810": "What is she doing?",
	"726811": "This is Popo's speciality. When he strikes like this, pretty much anything can be fixed mysteriously and quickly.",
	"726812": "I am not sure why it is fixed.",
	"726813": "Really? It's not hard for me to understand.",
	"726814": "Hey Popo, don't hit it too loud.",
	"726815": "Yes.",
	"726816": "It doesn't work. It seems that the usual methods don't fix it. Apparently it is not \"that kind\" of failure.",
	"726817": "You have to disassemble the gun.",
	"726819": "Hm?",
	"726820": "This can be found at .......",
	"726821": "A piece of paper with writing on it is attached to the connection of the gunstock.",
	"726822": "Museum of Victory in the Aftermath War, Collection No. 116-W-31.\"",
	"726823": "It was written so on a piece of paper that looked like a faded label.",
	"726824": "Your Excellency, were there any items that you saw that you would like?",
	"726825": "Not particularly. And the fact that you called a repairman means that you don't have a void printer either. --Save your weapons and equipment.",
	"726826": "Then would you like to see the medicine?",
	"726827": "So the gun was a museum exhibit. But why is this person ......?",
	"726828": "As she pondered, Victor pulled out another wheelbarrow and showed it to her.",
	"726829": "We have enough medicine for you. Take a look. We also have a box of Honkai erosion inhibitors. But I am sorry to say that this is not for sale. It's a lifesaver at a critical time.",
	"726830": "Hearing these words, Popo turned around without thinking.",
	"726831": "Perhaps in red packaging?",
	"726832": "Do you have any military stimulants? If you don't have military supplies, the old Human Qi Federation supplies would be fine.",
	"726833": "Is that it? ...... Our drug supplier is--",
	"726834": "Um, Mr. Victor.",
	"726836": "This gun has a very precise construction and I am unable to fix it without spare parts.",
	"726837": "Hmm, okay. Your Excellency at ......, are you interested in an attack drone--",
	"726838": "Mr. Victor.",
	"726840": "Can I ...... go now?",
	"726841": "............ popo, you know that you have to show respect to Victor at all times.",
	"726842": "Why doesn't she just go home already? I hate it when kids wander around in the middle of a serious conversation.",
	"726843": "Yes, yes, I understand. Popo, you can go now.",
	"726844": "Thank you for .......",
	"726846": "Popo, you want to buy lunch?",
	"726847": "Yes, I have. My mom wants some canned fish. One please.",
	"726848": "Yes. ...... Yes, I wonder if you could fix this heater a little bit.",
	"726849": "I understand.",
	"726850": "Bang bang!",
	"726851": "\"How's it going? Still no fix?\"",
	"726852": "I'm sorry. I'm not feeling very well today. I'm in a bit of a hurry, so maybe another time.",
	"726853": "I get it.\"",
	"726854": "Well then.",
	"726856": "Bang!",
	"726857": "I returned home and put the food I had bought on my desk. Then I checked to make sure there were no signs that anyone had touched the place where the gun was hidden.",
	"726858": "Huh. .......",
	"726859": "Ah .................. ah ......... ...!",
	"726860": "And Popo leaned against the wall without any strength, as if someone had pulled out his spine.",
	"726861": "The dreaded .......",
	"726862": "I just ...... my hands ....... My hands didn't stop shaking .......",
	"726863": "The heart is .......",
	"726864": "I thought my heart was going to jump out of my mouth ......!",
	"726866": "I learned two facts at Victor's warehouse.",
	"726867": "It was still red.",
	"726868": "First, the fact that there is at least one box of Type II Honkai erosion inhibitors in Victor's warehouse.",
	"726869": "And .......",
	"726870": "He uses an implanted body and has an old gun that he took from a museum ...... that scares Victor so much .......",
	"726871": "That man is not ...... a high-ranking military official or a fugitive soldier. ......",
	"726872": "There was no longer any doubt. It had been talked about often on the Internet before--",
	"726873": "--that entity that people who lost their homes spoke of after the disaster of the Honkai .......",
	"726874": "There is no military stationed here, so it is no wonder Victor is so afraid of them. No ...... even if there was an army stationed here, they could easily kill us all.",
	"726875": "They are brutal people who hunt sacramentalists using weapons of military use or worse, and provide them as samples to the institute for a bounty.",
	"726876": "That guy is a <color=#DC143CFF>stigmata hunter</color>.",
	"726878": "Mom? I fell on the floor again. ......",
	"726879": "......Pa......",
	"726880": "The floor is cold, isn't it? I'll hold you up and lift you into bed. ...... Use a blanket so you don't get cold.",
	"726883": "Light. Very light.",
	"726884": "It is so light that even a girl does not need to exert herself.",
	"726885": "Mom and that drug: ....... Your mother and that gun: ....... Which one is heavier?",
	"726888": "Popo stared into the distance. The sky was dark and dreary, with only one bright star shining in the distance.",
	"726889": "It's already night .......",
	"726890": "I don't know the name of that star. But not a single person cares about that in the current situation. Just like no one cares about my name.",
	"726891": "Sometimes I felt as if that star was just like me. Because it seemed as if neither that star nor I belonged to this time period.",
	"726892": "Ta-ta, ta-ta: ......",
	"726894": "Victor's men walked right by. He didn't seem to pay any attention to the popo there, as if they were dust.",
	"726895": "Victor's hideout is just up ahead.",
	"726896": "Huh. .......",
	"726897": "It was still terrifying. When I thought of that <color=#DC143CFF>stigmata hunter</color>, when I thought of Victor, I couldn't stop my body from shaking.",
	"726898": "But there was no other option.",
	"726899": "The red one, if only I could get that red box.",
	"726900": "I put it inside ............ no one has found it .......",
	"726902": "(I think there's some kind of commotion going on around me.)",
	"726903": "Fire! Everybody, put the fire out now--",
	"726904": "Was this a fire at the ...... warehouse?",
	"726905": "But it's now or never.",
	"726906": "The medicine cabinet was just down the street, I believe.",
	"726907": "The flames are ...... spreading faster and faster. But we're almost there, and though it's dangerous, we have to keep going--",
	"726909": "I see it! Red box! Hippocrates Group Medicines ......",
	"726911": "Why?",
	"726912": "Why is it empty?",
	"726913": "(I don't understand. Why. Did someone take them in the chaos? But did they bother to close the box after taking the drugs?)",
	"726914": "Kuk--",
	"726917": "Victor, Mr. Victor!",
	"726918": "Victor's face emerged from the flames. Light and shadow flickered in the flames, and his expression looked both terrifying and mysterious.",
	"726919": "Wow, wow, I just went to .......",
	"726920": "(What should I do? Explain? Or run away? Or with a gun ......)",
	"726921": "You, oma ...... that .......",
	"726922": "Wow ...... it wasn't me. I started the fire.",
	"726923": "Victor appeared to be about to continue and say something, when suddenly he opened his mouth wide and the next thing I knew, he was spitting out a thick cloud of black smoke and soot.",
	"726924": "Of course you didn't start the fire.\"",
	"726925": "Are you ...... Mr. Victor ......?",
	"726926": "A funny voice came from Victor's chest area. Then Victor got taller and taller - no, he did not get taller and taller. Victor was being lifted up by someone grabbing him by the neck.",
	"726927": "I was the one who set the fire.",
	"726928": "Hmmm, not a single thing was better. They made a bunch of fancy-looking boxes to sell that crap, and they were trying to sell it off to the highest bidder.",
	"726929": "From the flames emerged a being more horrifying than a charred corpse.",
	"726930": "Oh, \"Popo\", we meet again. I wonder if you noticed that I like to shop for free and came to have a look around?",
	"726931": "She spoke to me in a friendly manner.",
	"726932": "'You hear someone's voice coming from inside? Hey, guys, over here! This isn't an accidental fire, someone's been robbing us!\"",
	"726933": "Oh, oh you ...... you are that--!",
	"726934": "Well, it looks like I'm going to have to do it. You stay back. Unless you want to be a shield.",
	"726935": "Yes? ...... yes--",
	"726936": "Hah ...... hah ...... hah -- ugh!",
	"726937": "Shh, don't breathe so heavily.",
	"726938": "Find them.",
	"726941": "Okay, there you go.",
	"726942": "I thank you. If I hadn't been able to hide in your house like this, I would have had to run another 10 kilometers to get away.",
	"726943": "...... because it was that situation. Besides, you helped me get out of it, and I thank you for that too.",
	"726944": "I remember ...... a loaded pistol stuck under a desk I picked up earlier. In this situation, I would--",
	"726945": "You keep looking at your desk, but you have a gun hidden there, don't you?",
	"726946": "Unfortunately, I have a barrier around my body. As long as I'm alive, live bullets are almost ineffective.",
	"726947": "...... don't like killing children and don't get any funny ideas.",
	"726948": "I knew ............ you are a \"Stigmata Hunter\".",
	"726949": "Stigmata hunters? ...... Well, well, let's find out. We are ruthless beings who don't blink when we kill.",
	"726950": "So, would you be willing to stay the night? Thank you.",
	"726951": "........................ Yes.",
	"726952": "Haha, I'm glad we're on the same page. I'll feel free to stay the night then--",
	"726953": "BANG--!",
	"726954": "Who--",
	"726955": "Feeling a tug on his person, the stigmata hunter immediately pulled out the short-tube shotgun at his waist and pointed the muzzle in the direction of the tug.",
	"726956": "Mother!",
	"726957": "I stood there protecting my mom before the stigmata hunter pulled the trigger.",
	"726959": "She looked at him for a while, then put her gun away and said.",
	"726960": "If we shoot, those guys are going to gather here. So I promise not to hit them.",
	"726961": "So quickly ...... tell your mother to return what she just took from you. And by the way, I promise not to harm you guys.",
	"726962": "...... I can only believe in that promise of yours now.",
	"726963": "Mother .......",
	"726964": "I knew that being on guard would do me no good. So I turned around and sat down next to my mother, who was shrinking on the ground.",
	"726965": "Mom, what did you take? Can you give it to me? Without it, we'll be killed.",
	"726966": "U......Yi...... no.......",
	"726967": "Don't say that. ......",
	"726968": "I fearfully took the blanket that wrapped my mother's body. Then I exposed to the eyes of a third person the image of my mother now that I would have to turn away.",
	"726969": "No ...... it hurts ...... like it's going to burn .......",
	"726970": "My mother breathed hard and tried to resist somehow. Her chest rose and fell violently and her ribs became visible as she breathed. My mother covered her chest with both hands, and it was obvious that the object she had taken was there.",
	"726971": "Then I'll get it from .......",
	"726972": "To make it a little easier for my mother to accept, Popo told her what he was going to do next. Then he reached out and pulled it from his mother's pocket.",
	"726973": "My mother was very weak. This was what my mother looked like now, eroded by Honkai energy. My mother, who used to work at the power plant, was a very healthy person, but now she did not even have the strength to resist.",
	"726974": "He easily released his mother's grip and retrieved it from her hand. There it was, a small bottle of medicine.",
	"726975": "Ah.",
	"726976": "Type II inhibitors ...... I see.",
	"726977": "No wonder this stigmata hunter didn't want it then. She had it originally.",
	"726978": "I'm sorry. I'll return it right away.",
	"726979": "Aaaaahhh--",
	"726980": "Just as she was about to hand the suppressant to the hunter, the ineffectual mother suddenly and furiously leaped at the popo and bit his hand.",
	"726982": "Don't shoot me! --This way, I'll be fine. I'll return the ...... pills to you. ...... please.",
	"726983": "You guys: ......",
	"726984": "Popo picked up a bottle of medicine and handed it to Hunter.",
	"726985": "Are you ...... sure you're okay?",
	"726986": "It really doesn't hurt a bit. I was just a little surprised.",
	"726987": "I'm not stingy when it comes to disinfectant. What about the truth?",
	"726988": "It's really okay ...... I just noticed it too .......",
	"726989": "All of my mother's teeth have fallen out and it looks like she doesn't have any left. ......",
	"726990": "Ugh. .......",
	"726991": "Ughhhh ...... ughhhh .......",
	"726992": "Ha......Gohogoho......Hunter, I can actually fix that gun of yours. But I lied that I couldn't fix it because I knew that if I did, even more people would be killed. So, ...... will you do me a favor in exchange for fixing that ...... gun?",
	"726993": "Please, please, please. Please give me that medicine because I will fix anything.",
	"726995": "You know that, don't you? You know that, given your mother's current situation, she can't be saved by staying here.",
	"726996": "If the condition deteriorates to this point, even 100 or even 1,000 bottles, let alone one suppressant, may not help.",
	"726997": "Even in the unlikely event that I recover and the hallucinations and burning pain disappear--even if, after a week or so, I temporarily return to normal--I will still be able to see the world.",
	"726998": "In another three or four days, he will lose consciousness and die of organ failure. Don't you know that much, too?",
	"726999": "But ...... if there is even the slightest possibility of .......",
	"727000": "I'm sorry, but I can't give you this. This medicine is very important to me--",
	"727001": "It is a lie! Stigmata hunters were originally supposed to be either Stigmata users or recipients of pseudo-stigmata implanted bodies! Even junior high school students know that! ...... even though you people have nothing to do with the erosion of Honkai. ......",
	"727002": "Please. How much do I have to pay you to give it to me? I will do whatever I can do! Please, please, please! Please give me that medicine!",
	"727004": "It's true what you say. Neither the recipient nor the sacramentalist needs inhibitors. But I am neither now.",
	"727005": "Eh? But your body has a substrate that the recipient uses--",
	"727006": "Yes, I do. But I don't have my ...... pseudo-stigmata. Because I lost my .......",
	"727007": "I can still use various Honkai energy equipment. But until I get a new pseudo-stigmatic implant, I also need to use inhibitors or something to control the erosion.",
	"727008": "With that, the stigmata hunter turned his back to me and indicated by his actions that he had nothing more to say to me. Then he walked toward the door as if he didn't want to see me any more.",
	"727010": "I'm sorry. I have something I have to do.",
	"727011": "But--",
	"727012": "Bang!",
	"727013": "The door closed.",
	"727015": "A sliver of hope was closed.",
	"727016": "How do I ...... what do I do .......",
	"727017": "Pa......",
	"727018": "Mom ...... earlier. ....... Sorry about earlier. ......",
	"727019": "Listen to ...... and ......",
	"727020": "What's up? ...... Okay, I'll ask.",
	"727025": "If I had known what was going on, I would not have followed you. I never thought I would have to witness a situation like that.",
	"727026": "I am not qualified to worry about other people's lives and deaths right now. Besides, I shouldn't have anything to do with a small, soon-to-be-destroyed community in the first place.",
	"727027": "Snap.",
	"727029": "Does this mean that the ...... high concentration of Honkai energy crystallized and the lights went out?",
	"727030": "Stigmata Hunter, .......\"",
	"727031": "A low voice came from the darkness.",
	"727032": "I told you. I told you I wouldn't give you drugs.",
	"727033": "Hunter, do you like to gamble?",
	"727034": "The lights came on.",
	"727035": "What are you ...... doing with a gun?",
	"727036": "I told you that live ammunition wouldn't work on me.",
	"727037": "The girl picked up the gun she had prepared in case of emergency and removed the safety. She then held it to her temple.",
	"727038": "Mr. Stigmata Hunter.",
	"727039": "I was so scared of you from the moment I found out who you were.",
	"727040": "I was afraid to get involved with you.",
	"727041": "I was afraid that I would be killed.",
	"727042": "I was afraid of being found out.",
	"727043": "With the hand opposite to the one holding the gun, she began unbuttoning her clothes, gradually exposing her breasts.",
	"727044": "I was afraid that you would know that I was an awakened sacramental user.",
	"727046": "The light went out again. No, not gone - the light was taken away.",
	"727047": "Even the night vision mode of the mask had become useless.",
	"727048": "Hmmm, you used this ability to sneak into the warehouse. I was under the mistaken impression that young people today are capable of such things.",
	"727049": "Neither the auxiliary lighting mode nor the infrared mode helped, and I was finally able to supplement the girl in ...... sonar mode.",
	"727050": "The stigmatic implants used by stigmatic hunters are not provided by the military.",
	"727051": "Stigmata hunters are employed by the Stigmata bureaus of the various armies, and they kill or kidnap people with awakened stigmata and use them as guinea pigs for research.",
	"727052": "The pseudo-stigmata they use are obtained that way. But a hunter without a stigmatic implant is in a very dangerous situation - right?",
	"727054": "That means I am very valuable to you.",
	"727055": "Would you sell me that inhibitor?",
	"727056": "The price was my own--",
	"727057": "It is the most valuable consideration you can offer me.",
	"727058": "...... I take you to the Stigmata Station and sell you? That's too much risk and uncertainty.",
	"727059": "Yes. Because this is a wager. I bet that you agree with this idea.",
	"727060": "If I don't take that bet, you pull the trigger and take your own life so that I get nothing.",
	"727061": "Yes, I am willing to do this. If we agree and all goes well, we could get a lot of money and pseudo-stigmata.",
	"727062": "What do you want to do?",
	"727065": "Hmph, that's a given.",
	"727069": "Thank you for your patience.",
	"727070": "How's it going? Did you get your mom to drink it?",
	"727071": "Yes. .......",
	"727072": "Feel a little better?",
	"727073": "Maybe ...... that should be the case.",
	"727074": "Now, is there anything else you would like to bring? Mr. My Booty.",
	"727075": "No, I don't. I don't own anything.",
	"727076": "I don't mind if I use a sarcasm. ......Yes, I should introduce myself. From now on, you can call me Cold Steel. And you?",
	"727077": "...... popo.",
	"727078": "I agree. Maybe it is fair to call them by their nicknames.",
	"727079": "I still haven't heard what kind of power your stigmata have. If it's a stupid ability, can I return it to ...... after all this time?",
	"727080": "What ...... are you kidding?",
	"727081": "Hahaha, it's going to be a long journey ahead, so you might as well get used to my personality as soon as possible.",
	"727082": "Are you sure your power is the ability to manipulate light?",
	"727083": "Yeah. .......",
	"727084": "You can manipulate light to hide yourself or block out light completely at ....... Maybe there is something else I can do.",
	"727085": "Wow, a light stigmata? Never heard of it. ...... Well, let's leave anyway.",
	"727086": "We're going to follow this road, got it?",
	"727087": "Is there a car or something? And this direction--do you mean towards that huge crack?",
	"727088": "A giant crack? Ah, that is certainly a fitting term to call the crack caused by the sudden appearance of Honkai energy.",
	"727089": "Yes, that's where we're going. You're a sacramentalist, too, and that much Honkai energy won't kill you.",
	"727090": "Why are you heading over there?",
	"727091": "Well, you'll see. My journey with you is about to begin - if you try to run away, I'll kill you at ...... right away.",
	"727094": "Thus, the curtain rose on an adventure that began with a blazing fire and ended with a torrential downpour.",
	"727095": "Tontonton.",
	"727096": "Hm?",
	"727097": "Tontontontonton.",
	"727098": "It's the weekend and who are you in the morning? The one who is knocking.",
	"727099": "I woke up, opened the curtains, and sunlight shone into the bedroom.",
	"727100": "The lights on the computer are on. It seems I was playing late yesterday and forgot to turn off the switch.",
	"727101": "When I moved the mouse, the screen also came on. The screen showed the current time and the top page of the news, and on top of that the results of the front ....... Apparently our camp had won.",
	"727102": "Of course. Because <color=#DC143CFF>our army<color=#DC143CFF>has even defeated the Human Qi Federation.",
	"727103": "But I don't think that matters much to students.",
	"727104": "The fight has been going on for a long time, but I never really felt it. Maybe it is because I live far away.",
	"727105": "Dong dong dong!",
	"727106": "Who the hell is this?",
	"727107": "Mom, someone's here!",
	"727109": "Huh? Was today the day to go to the power plant?",
	"727110": "I came to the living room in my pajamas and looked toward the kitchen. I see a figure moving through the glass window. It looks like my mother is listening to some program while cooking again. ......",
	"727111": "Dong-dong-dong! Don-don-don-don!!! Boom Boom Boom Boom ！！！！",
	"727112": "Yes, yes, I understand. Totally, I can't believe you still keep knocking even though no one is responding.",
	"727113": "I headed for the front door with that thought in mind.",
	"727114": "Who are you?",
	"727115": "Mother. Paris, open it quickly!",
	"727118": "Is that your mother's voice?",
	"727119": "But if it's your mother behind this door, who's in the ...... kitchen?",
	"727120": "U ----------------",
	"727121": "What? What? What's going on? What is that sound, all of a sudden?",
	"727122": "UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU --------------------",
	"727123": "The windowpane is shaking. Outside the window, an air-raid alarm is blaring.",
	"727124": "What? What do you mean?",
	"727125": "What's wrong? It's quite noisy outside.",
	"727126": "The glass door to the kitchen was opened and my mother, wearing an apron, tilted her head and asked.",
	"727127": "Mom, I think it's probably an air-raid alarm.",
	"727128": "Citizens. This is not a drill. According to the information that just came in from the Corps' command headquarters--\"",
	"727129": "The die is cast and the answer will be known shortly. Immediately--\"",
	"727132": "Immediately ...... what?",
	"727133": "And after that? Why did I suddenly stop hearing?",
	"727134": "For a moment, the place went quiet. The sound of the computer fan in the bedroom was no longer audible.",
	"727135": "I'm kind of scared. Mom, we--",
	"727136": "Mother?",
	"727137": "When I turned toward the kitchen, there was no one there.",
	"727138": "Boom, boom, boom, boom--",
	"727139": "Paris, open the door quickly! We have to get out of here!",
	"727140": "This is .......",
	"727141": "Puzzled, anxious, confused, trembling - a cool sensation came from the doorknob.",
	"727142": "As I turned the doorknob, I heard the sound of the security door unlocking.",
	"727143": "Suddenly, the person outside pushed open the door. Then he pushed me to the ground, grabbed my hand, and bit me with tremendous force--and then he was gone.",
	"727144": "But ...... it didn't hurt at all. Because that was my mother. My mother had no more teeth.",
	"727145": "Paris...... mother it hurts, it hurts so bad. Everyday it hurts like it burns my bones too. This is all because of you ...... you. ......",
	"727146": "I fell to the cold floor and listened to my mother whisper in my ear. Unable to look at my mother, I could only turn my head away and look out the window.",
	"727147": "Outside the window, the sky shattered and a huge wave made of dust from far beyond the horizon came rushing in and filled the field of vision.",
	"727148": "And I was swept up in it.",
	"727150": "Ah!",
	"727151": "Morning of the second day of the trip.",
	"727152": "Oh, you're up. How do you like it? Would you like to try some of my dry bread?",
	"727153": "Cold Iron, who was sitting by the extinguished bonfire, woke up and spoke to me.",
	"727154": "--this is the real world. Your daily life, your past memories, it's all gone.",
	"727155": "This is ...... just dry bread, right?",
	"727156": "It's my original. There is still some meat in this can if you want some. But I think the meat got stuck to the bottom and I'm trying to get it out.",
	"727157": "Tontontontonton!",
	"727158": "Tontontontonton!",
	"727159": "Oh, it's coming out. Want some?",
	"727160": "I don't want it. ......",
	"727161": "I stood up and wiped my face with my sleeve. Then I stared at the sunlit wilderness and the asphalt road.",
	"727162": "You continue all the way down this road today.",
	"727163": "That's right. According to my calculations, we should be there in seven days.",
	"727164": "You can't get that far on foot in 7 days ......, right?",
	"727165": "You won't have to walk a dick up ahead. Porcupine will be here soon. And then we'll have something a little better to eat.",
	"727166": "Porcupine is ...... another stigmata hunter?",
	"727167": "No, it's not. It's an autonomous infantry fighting vehicle. It has military-grade Honkai-resistant armor and can operate close to the cracks. Well, it's my ammo box and my vehicle.",
	"727168": "But because of the cracks, they can't be remotely operated right now.",
	"727169": "Doooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong--",
	"727170": "What - it's like a sound .......",
	"727171": "Looks like I picked the right spot. There's a porcupine right next to me.",
	"727173": "The ground shook slightly and the dirt danced up. Then a vehicle the size of a tank, which I had seen on film before, appeared from deep in the wilderness.",
	"727174": "The vehicle approached us as the red monitoring device, reminiscent of a signal, wavered.",
	"727175": "Is this ...... military weaponry?",
	"727176": "The Porcupine's surveillance equipment must have recognized me as a target, because a machine gun appeared from the side of the vehicle.",
	"727177": "Porcupine, stop. She's one of ours. Stop the attack and register her biometric.",
	"727178": "-- [Bwin! -- [boing!",
	"727179": "How's that? This response sound. Sounds like a pig, doesn't it? We call him Porcupine because he not only moves and fights, but also digs holes. Isn't he cute!",
	"727180": "Oh ...... yeah ...... maybe cute ......?",
	"727181": "Upon closer inspection, I found that the infantry fighting vehicle had numerous bullet holes and scuff marks. Moreover, for some reason, I could also see dents that looked as if they had been made by something ...... grabbing it.",
	"727182": "Porcupine, open the door.",
	"727183": "As she said this, the door of the infantry fighting vehicle opened. Inside, Cold Steel got in, and after rummaging around for a while for something, he picked up a can of luncheon meat and tossed it in my direction.",
	"727184": "It's a can of melin. After we eat that, we'll leave and continue on this road. If you do what I say, I'll let you drive. ...... Want to give it a try?",
	"727185": "Wow ...... the date of production of these cans, when the head of the Human Contractors Federation was still Meryn Cavendish.",
	"727186": "Isn't that why they call it Mellin Canning? ...... It doesn't matter what it's called. The point is, as long as you can eat it. Not at all, youngsters nowadays. Hey, Porcupine.",
	"727187": "(Machine gun coming out.) -- [Bwin!\" -- [Bwin!",
	"727188": "All right, all right, all right. I'll eat it!",
	"727190": "Rumble rattle rattle rattle!",
	"727191": "Ugh--oops!",
	"727192": "Porcupines were pushing vigorously down the road. The spot where we had camped yesterday quickly disappeared from sight.",
	"727193": "You can puke all you want, but just don't get on the porcupine's spines.",
	"727194": "The \"porcupine spikes\" she refers to are the machine guns of these infantry fighting vehicles. But I was a little too late. The dregs of luncheon meat had already stuck to the \"porcupine spike\" and added historical gravity to the porcupine's figure.",
	"727195": "Hah .......",
	"727196": "Does that clear things up a bit?",
	"727197": "Yeah. .......",
	"727198": "Once we're clear, we'll speed it up. Go! Porcupine!",
	"727199": "-- [Bwin! -- [boing!",
	"727200": "Wow.",
	"727202": "Haa...... haa...... haa...... haa...... haa.......",
	"727203": "Okay, that's enough for today. It's time to rest now.",
	"727204": "Finally, .......",
	"727205": "If I have to rush ahead like this, shaking like this for the next few days, I might die before ...... you sell me out. ......",
	"727206": "Don't worry. If I'm right, the mode of transportation should change tomorrow.",
	"727207": "Tomorrow?",
	"727208": "Come on, it's dinner time, let's talk about something.",
	"727209": "Is that an instruction ......?",
	"727210": "Well, if I don't do what you say, it doesn't mean I can't boil or bake you. Because I have to protect your life. I simply miss you because I haven't talked to you as a human being for so long.",
	"727211": "Have you not talked to people for a long time?",
	"727212": "Yes, I did. I've been trying for months to get away from that place.",
	"727213": "While cooking canned food in a pot, Kantetsu made a gesture as if to indicate the direction of the nearby sky with his chin. There, a huge crack caused by the collapse energy was quietly floating in the air.",
	"727214": "Are these numerous scratches on the equipment ...... from escaping from there?",
	"727215": "Yeah, we almost lost you. We were almost out of weapons and ammunition. Fortunately, thanks to Porcupine, we managed to escape.",
	"727216": "Okay, so ......, that's--",
	"727217": "I imitated her and pointed toward the sky with the tip of my chin.",
	"727218": "What the hell is that crack? Was it a natural disaster?",
	"727221": "To tell you the truth, I don't know either.",
	"727222": "It could be a new major collapse, or it could be the work of the Legion. I have no idea what's going on right now either, because long-distance communication devices are totally useless in this area.",
	"727223": "Yeah ......",
	"727224": "Who in the world won the civil war? Who created this fissure? And we don't even know if the organization that controls the ...... human society still exists today.",
	"727225": "I see: ......",
	"727226": "I wonder what the hell those guys are doing at all.",
	"727227": "......fu Oh ............",
	"727228": "Sleepy? Well, maybe it's time for a good boy to get some rest?",
	"727229": "Maybe it's because I've been throwing up all ...... the time and I'm ...... tired of it. ......",
	"727230": "Go to bed. We won't be moving any more this evening.",
	"727231": "Yeah ...... I'm off to bed then ......",
	"727232": "I lay down and fell into a dream.",
	"727236": "Guns.",
	"727237": "It's an old semi-automatic handgun.",
	"727238": "The gun uses live ammunition, not disintegrating energy, but it can still kill people.",
	"727239": "......Pa......",
	"727240": "I had secretly stolen that gun before anyone noticed.",
	"727241": "My heart was racing. Like the child who sneaked a candy bar, I tried to appear calm as I ran away, but I couldn't stay calm.",
	"727242": "Bad and selfish children.",
	"727243": "When I opened the door, my mother was lying on the bed.",
	"727244": "......Pa......Paris......",
	"727245": "With an unaccustomed hand, he loaded the bullets and took aim with a shaky hand.",
	"727246": "It hurts ...... ......",
	"727247": "Then he closed his eyes and pulled the trigger.",
	"727248": "Bang!",
	"727250": "I felt a twinge all over my body and woke up instantly.",
	"727251": "(Also ...... dream ......)",
	"727252": "It was a terrible dream. I'm glad I woke up.",
	"727253": "But waking up doesn't mean much. Reality is like a nightmare. This trip, in the end, is like being taken to the grave for an extended period of time.",
	"727254": "Sleep is also part of this harsh punishment.",
	"727256": "But ...... would there have been any other way?",
	"727257": "Star .......",
	"727258": "I looked up at the sky and saw a star. It was a small, bright star in the distance.",
	"727259": "It seemed lonely, floating in the air as if it did not know what to do.",
	"727260": "If they had been shining like this a few decades ago, or even a few hundred years ago, there would have been more people on earth to pay attention to them, right? But in today's chaotic world, no one has time to think about the stars in the sky.",
	"727261": "Am I the only one in the world today who is gazing at that star like this?",
	"727262": "But that I too will die soon. By that man. ......",
	"727263": "Looking closer, I saw a porcupine silently shrinking in the shadows of the street. Cold Steel was sitting on top of it, looking up at the sky. I wondered what the face hidden by her mask looked like now.",
	"727266": "She seemed to be staring at that star too.",
	"727267": "I don't know why, but I suddenly had a strange sensation. I felt as if she were a lonely star, not of this time period.",
	"727268": "I have heard in class that it takes decades to a century or more for the light emitted by a star to reach the earth. In other words, what people on Earth can see is only the past of the stars.",
	"727269": "I felt a kind of inexpressible feeling from her. She appeared to be an ordinary hunter, but at the same time she had a very ......",
	"727270": "It felt like a light coming from the past.",
	"727271": "Cold Iron: ......",
	"727272": "What? You're finally talking to me, aren't you? You want to know what I'm thinking right now?",
	"727274": "I thought, \"This stain on Porcupine's machine gun looks very much like a vomit stain.",
	"727275": "It's my imagination.",
	"727276": "Let's not think too much. Whatever you think about, it's just your own idea.",
	"727278": "That ......",
	"727279": "Why didn't you come to the base where we were living that day, riding a porcupine?",
	"727280": "Why should they?",
	"727281": "Then you wouldn't have had to run away. You could have used weapons to wipe them out.",
	"727282": "Yes, ...... but you're wrong.",
	"727283": "The person in charge of that base had only live ammunition. So even without the porcupines, I could have easily snapped the necks of Vic and all of his men with my bare hands.",
	"727284": "But, if we kill them all, the people living there will be in trouble, right?",
	"727285": "Is that something you care about, too?",
	"727286": "......Yes, well, ...... for example, if you are a fisherman, you have a responsibility not to annihilate all the fish with a fine net, similar to that, I guess.",
	"727287": "I see.",
	"727288": "Otherwise, what's the point?",
	"727290": "Cold iron.",
	"727291": "What?",
	"727292": "I wonder how my mom is doing now?",
	"727293": "That guy? I bet he's sleeping well right now.",
	"727294": "How can you be so sure?",
	"727295": "Because I'm an adult, I've seen a lot of symptoms like that.",
	"727296": "By now, they're resting easy, relieved from their long suffering.",
	"727297": "I know, right? ......",
	"727298": "It's late and I'm going to bed. Are you sleepy too?",
	"727299": "Hmmm......... I'm feeling a little better.",
	"727300": "Even if I get well, you'll still have to sleep. It would be a disaster if he escaped while I was sleeping.",
	"727301": "Then she forced me into the sleeping bag and zipped it closed. And I was enveloped in darkness.",
	"727302": "I think I'll go to bed: ......",
	"727303": "I closed my eyes. But for some reason, my mother did not appear in my dream this time.",
	"727304": "Perhaps my mother is sleeping better today.",
	"727308": "Guong Guong Guong Guong ......",
	"727309": "Ugh. ...... oops!",
	"727310": "Don't put it on porcupine spines.",
	"727311": "It's okay ...... I didn't eat anything this morning ...... today!",
	"727312": "Why are you being so unreasonable!",
	"727314": "Why did it suddenly go dark?",
	"727315": "There are mountains ahead. We have to go through a tunnel. Quick, pull your head out.",
	"727316": "Yeah, but why not turn on the lights?",
	"727317": "Because--",
	"727318": "Don!",
	"727320": "I heard what sounded like an explosion from behind me.",
	"727321": "What was that sound you just heard?",
	"727322": "The tunnel collapsed.",
	"727323": "What?",
	"727324": "I knew those guys were setting up an ambush here.",
	"727325": "Cold Steel stopped the car, picked up his rifle, and jumped off the porcupine.",
	"727326": "Hide in the porcupine. They get down and don't move.",
	"727327": "Yeah. ...... yeah.",
	"727328": "Porcupine, turn on the light.",
	"727329": "-- [Bwin! -- [boing!",
	"727330": "The lights came on with the voice. What in the world ...... wait, that rapidly growing fireball on the periscope screen!",
	"727331": "Don!",
	"727332": "Found!",
	"727333": "The cold steel fired two shots in the direction from which the fireball came. Then, from the darkness, the enemy returned with the tow light emitted by the gun.",
	"727334": "Okay, Porcupine. Turn off the light. You dig to the right of the wall and hide. I'm going to start a war.",
	"727335": "-- [Bwin! -- [boing!",
	"727336": "Dah-dah-dah--",
	"727337": "That's just outrageous. Haha, a world without order is like a jungle after all. In the jungle, it's the law to fight and compare strength, right?",
	"727338": "So what's this all about!",
	"727339": "What else could it be? You've run into a colleague.",
	"727340": "These guys, you know, they're looking to snatch people's prey. -------- ------ They're stigmata hunters!",
	"727341": "Don--",
	"727342": "Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada ...... ...... ......",
	"727343": "I got down in the porcupine, protecting my head. I could do nothing. All I could do was listen to the intermittent gunshots that were getting weaker and weaker.",
	"727344": "After a while, no more gunshots were heard.",
	"727347": "It's pitch black. Which one won?",
	"727348": "If there are a number of opponents, will the cold iron lose? If so, what should I do?",
	"727349": "Oh, but if she loses, can I escape by any chance?",
	"727350": "You can't ...... do that. They are sacrament hunters, and in the end, they will be taken to the sacrament bureau and used for animal experiments and killed, of course.",
	"727351": "But the fact that the other guy is a sacrament hunter, she just said that, right? Or maybe she just said that on purpose because she was worried that I might run away while she was fighting?",
	"727352": "And it seems that the other side was only using guns, not the power of the sacrament. So maybe it was a military unit? If it's a military unit, they might be able to ...... save the day, right?",
	"727354": "But where am I supposed to go when I get outside?",
	"727355": "And am I even qualified to help?",
	"727356": "Like me, like me: ......",
	"727357": "Does someone as despicable as I am really deserve to be saved?",
	"727358": "Click!",
	"727359": "Hey, it's done. When you come out.",
	"727360": "As I was thinking this, the door suddenly opened and I saw the bloody cold iron and the sunlight at the same time.",
	"727361": "......うん ......",
	"727363": "I walked out of Porcupine in a daze. Porcupine had been pulled to one side of the tunnel and enemy corpses were lying everywhere.",
	"727364": "They mean ......",
	"727365": "They were using military weapons, so I guess they were bandits made up of survivors of the destroyed units. I was the only enemy, and they went to great lengths to choose favorable terrain for their attack.",
	"727366": "As I cautiously approached one of the bodies, I saw a badge on the dead man's chest.",
	"727367": "First ...... Legion ......",
	"727368": "<color=#DC143CFF>My Army</color>...... that the First Corps had been defeated ......?",
	"727370": "I don't know, but probably not.",
	"727371": "Cold Steel looked at the corpse for a moment and turned his head in the other direction, but after a while he looked back at the corpse again. But in the end, he ducked down as if he had given up.",
	"727372": "Oh, this is nice! This is a military motocross bike, I bet!",
	"727373": "What?",
	"727374": "I looked in that direction and sure enough, there was one motorcycle with military markings scraped off.",
	"727375": "It doesn't seem to have a smart core, but it seems to work somehow. There it is, out of the way, out of the way. This is quite a haul. We've got a disintegrator energy weapon, enough live ammo and explosives. Porcupine must be full now.",
	"727376": "Oops! This could be useful, too. It's a map showing the current expansion scale of the collapse energy fissure.",
	"727377": "The cold steel seemed full of excitement and interest. He pushed me away and began to put captured firearms and other items into the porcupine.",
	"727378": "Ummm ......",
	"727379": "So the ...... journey continues, right?",
	"727380": "Oh yeah, I forgot one thing. Yeah ...... I think I'll just use this gun.",
	"727381": "With that, Kantetsu picked up a rifle with a long scope and focused it on a certain part of the sky.",
	"727382": "What are you doing ......?",
	"727383": "Don!",
	"727384": "Looks like something fell off ......?",
	"727385": "What? Don't you understand?",
	"727386": "Huh?",
	"727387": "The one you saw with me last night?",
	"727388": "What?",
	"727389": "It's a drone. That thing disguised as a star, it was a reconnaissance drone for these guys.",
	"727390": "I noticed that this drone was monitoring your base of operations. That's how I knew there were humans living there.",
	"727391": "I think these guys saw that I burned down your warehouse and thought they could get something more valuable by raiding me, so they switched their target to me.",
	"727392": "In a way, if I hadn't gone there, the thousands of lives that live there, they would have all been killed by now.",
	"727393": "The stars ...... my stars are ......",
	"727394": "What? What star?",
	"727395": "I knew it was ...... my assumption. ......",
	"727396": "I had no idea that that thing I thought was a star was meticulously prepared by someone who wants to kill us all. ......",
	"727398": "For a long time now, ......",
	"727399": "Yes, yes, okay.",
	"727400": "Ugh. ......!",
	"727401": "You're in pain, aren't you? I'll give you a hug.",
	"727402": "What ...... suddenly hugged me and ...... very rugged, but this armor ......",
	"727403": "Don't think it's creepy. Human beings are creatures that follow their genetically coded instincts. When we are going through a hard time, we need someone to hug us like this.",
	"727404": "That's true even if the other party is a cruel person like me. Instincts often defy logic, don't they?",
	"727405": "You can hug me all you want, but don't ...... pat me on the head like that. ...... Don't pat me on the head like that!",
	"727406": "This whole sequence of events is too cruel for a kid like you.",
	"727407": "You're doing well enough. At your age, you're willing to trade your own life to save your mother's life.",
	"727408": "You are very brave.",
	"727410": "That's not true: ......",
	"727411": "I'm not brave ...... I'm just a coward.",
	"727412": "All right, all right. You're right.",
	"727414": "Hey, cold iron?",
	"727415": "What?",
	"727416": "I ...... will be sold to the Stigmata Bureau by you in the end, won't I?",
	"727417": "Yes.",
	"727418": "And I'm going to be used as a guinea pig to be dissected and used in research to unravel the mystery of the Stigmata, right?",
	"727419": "Yes. That's the deal.",
	"727420": "Don't break that promise.",
	"727422": "I would much rather die a pre-determined death than live in a situation where I have nothing to rely on and have no idea what kind of cruelty will befall me tomorrow.",
	"727423": "And I don't like to tell people this, but I know it myself. I know that I'm not even worth dying for.",
	"727425": "...... sorry ......",
	"727426": "What is she talking about?",
	"727427": "We're trying a little harder ...... No, it's nothing.",
	"727428": "Well, well. Now that I too have been soothed by the soft breasts of a 16 year old girl, it's time to go!",
	"727429": "You people are not just following your instincts, you are being manipulated!",
	"727430": "I don't think so!",
	"727431": "Wait a minute. Now that we've filled the porcupine with supplies, how are we going to get around from here on out?",
	"727432": "Use that one.",
	"727433": "Which one is that? ...... Well, you don't mean that one, do you!",
	"727435": "Ha------ feels so good. I don't even care about traffic jams. It's really great to ride a motorcycle!",
	"727436": "Oh, and don't worry about Porcupine. I've set the meeting point so they'll catch up with us while we're sleeping!",
	"727437": "Oe oe oe oe oe oe oe oe ----",
	"727438": "Let's go! Our next goal is the big city!",
	"727439": "Third night of the trip.",
	"727440": "Popo, you're from the First Corps, right?",
	"727441": "Ummm ...... why do you ask that?",
	"727442": "Because you said \"<color=#DC143CFF>My army</color>\"?",
	"727443": "Strictly speaking, I am not a soldier, and there is no way that I belong to the military.",
	"727444": "Yeah, you seem to be learning a lot about general education, but you usually don't sleep well in class.",
	"727445": "It's kind of like being criticized. I thought class was not a time to sleep.",
	"727446": "Theoretically, it would go like this. The world war broke out when the Jinki-ren split into the Jinki-ren and the Seiki-ren, and these were pacified by the soldiers who rose up in arms. Then, all human beings in the world became members of the \"World Building Corps\" that was established by the soldiers who rose up in arms.",
	"727447": "I said \"our army\" earlier because my mother and I used to live in a town where the First Corps was stationed.",
	"727448": "In the textbooks, there is no division into Southern and Northern armies, and everything in the world belongs to the World Building Corps.",
	"727449": "I hope that's really true. I know that book descriptions and reality are often different. If the textbooks were true, I wouldn't be sitting here now.",
	"727450": "There's always a gap between the ideal and the reality, and it's always difficult to bridge it.",
	"727451": "Yes ...... cold iron, how old are you?",
	"727452": "Isn't it rude to ask such a question to a lady?",
	"727453": "You already know that I am 16 years old. I feel like it's really unfair that I'm the only one who doesn't know.",
	"727454": "Sixty.",
	"727455": "That means you were born in the West! Hm? Wait a minute, are you lying?",
	"727456": "Sixty, if you don't believe me, that's fine.",
	"727457": "Then try removing the mask .......",
	"727458": "No, I'll die if I take it off.",
	"727459": "You are an alien!",
	"727460": "No, I'm not. I'm a genuine earthling. I've just had some body modifications.",
	"727461": "That's in line with a post I saw on the internet before ...... that says powerful recipients have to undergo modification surgery, or else their bodies can't withstand the disintegrating energy. ......",
	"727462": "That's what it says. The internet is amazing.",
	"727463": "Are you really 60 years old?",
	"727464": "Yes. (a little frightened)",
	"727465": "I don't know, I just can't believe it. It's like he's telling a lie: ......",
	"727466": "But ...... if you're really 60 you know what you're talking about, right?",
	"727467": "What?",
	"727468": "My ...... world construction corps why did we have to go to war?",
	"727469": "Ee: ......",
	"727470": "I thought the <color=#DC143CFF>remnants of the Human Qi Federation</COLOR>had already been exterminated, the concept of a nation had been eliminated, and all mankind had been liberated?",
	"727471": "I thought we had overcome all the shackles that held humanity in bondage - principles, nations, ethnicities, religions, resources - hadn't we?",
	"727472": "So why are we still fighting each other in the quagmire that is the earth, covered in scars?",
	"727474": "I can't answer that question.",
	"727475": "When I respond that the cause that led to the calamity was the malicious decisions of some people or the plans of some scheming organization, it only comforts me.",
	"727476": "The answer to that question, perhaps, can only be found in the next generation. Why are we still fighting each other so vacantly after what should have been the last war?",
	"727477": "But one thing is certain. Unlike fairy tales, reality is not always about happy clichés and endings. The only certain ending is death.",
	"727478": "That ...... isn't the same as not answering anything.",
	"727479": "That's right. Because the person you're asking is me, of all people. I don't know anything.",
	"727480": "All I know is the fight. All I know is to run forward.",
	"727481": "I wish you'd think a little bit about the people you're riding with, whether you're running through or .......",
	"727482": "Noon on the fourth day of the trip.",
	"727485": ".................. Oh, there you go.",
	"727486": "I'm back.",
	"727487": "How did it go?",
	"727488": "No. The fridge in this place is broken. I don't think we'll be able to eat fresh meat.",
	"727489": "Too bad.",
	"727490": "But look, here!",
	"727491": "Saying this, Kantetsu happily carried a cart full of snacks toward me and Porcupine.",
	"727492": "Have you ever had this? I used to love them when I was little!",
	"727493": "When she opened the bag of pastries, she found what was probably gluten, with a lot of raayu on it.",
	"727494": "It looks like it has a persistent taste. ...... I don't really like salty food.",
	"727495": "Well, taste it!",
	"727496": "Kantetsu reached out and waved the pastry near my nose.",
	"727497": "Just one.",
	"727498": "-- [Bwin! -- [boing!",
	"727499": "Oh, you want some porcupine too?",
	"727500": "What are you joking about? You must have sensed an enemy or something.",
	"727501": "Cold Steel held up his rifle. I ducked behind Porcupine.",
	"727503": "Don! Boom-boom!",
	"727505": "How's it going?",
	"727506": "I peeked out from behind the porcupine and looked in the direction the cold steel had shot.",
	"727507": "I put it away.",
	"727508": "Is it another stigmata hunter ...... yeah?",
	"727509": "Before I could finish the sentence, I noticed something. I noticed something black and shiny shimmering around the corner of the road where her rifle was pointed.",
	"727510": "Is that ...... what?",
	"727511": "I don't know. They weren't there before the war, but after the cracks appeared, they started to appear.",
	"727512": "Some of them are tough, but they seem to get weaker the further you get away from the cracks of the collapse.",
	"727513": "Could this be a weapon created by the ...... corps?",
	"727514": "Ummm ......",
	"727515": "...... That can't be right, can it? It doesn't seem efficient enough to use as a weapon.",
	"727516": "I don't know.",
	"727517": "What?",
	"727518": "Let's leave aside what it is, well, if you can defeat it with a weapon, you don't need to be too alarmed.",
	"727519": "I hope so. ......",
	"727520": "The cold steel seemed to know how to deal with this kind of enemy. But the presence of a non ...... person was still scary.",
	"727521": "Gou ......",
	"727522": "After all, you're hungry. Come on, let's try to stave off hunger with junk food.",
	"727523": "How can you even think of eating under these circumstances?",
	"727524": "Dong-dong! Don!",
	"727525": "Oh ...... munchy ...... munchy one on the stairs over there ...... munchy one on the stairs over there.",
	"727526": "You're really good with your eyes. I'm on it.",
	"727527": "Don!",
	"727528": "Yeah ......",
	"727529": "What's wrong?",
	"727530": "Mustard-flavored potato chips are still better.",
	"727531": "I ...... actually wanted to compliment you on your gun skills.",
	"727532": "Munchies...... could go with the cucumber flavored ones, too.",
	"727533": "I pushed the cart with one hand and ate fries with the other as I made my way with Cold Iron down the small streets of an unfamiliar town.",
	"727534": "These eerie ...... beings stood by the side of the road as if they were neutral creatures in a video game. They emitted a low growl that was indistinct from within their bodies and seemed to be a mixture of many languages.",
	"727535": "After a while, both she and I gradually became less nervous as we got used to it. Then we calmly defeated those who appeared unlucky enough to be around us.",
	"727536": "Porcupine, do it.",
	"727537": "Upon receiving the order, Porcupine pressed the vehicle body against the wall. A short time later, the cement wall crumbled noisily, and a path that allowed him to proceed appeared in front of him.",
	"727538": "Cold Iron, our goal now is to break through this town?",
	"727539": "I'm not so sure if I'll be lucky. I, for one, would like to stop by the power plant here in town.",
	"727540": "Then why take the long way around like this instead of taking the main road?",
	"727541": "I can see it in this.",
	"727542": "Saying this, Kantetsu handed me a small terminal he had acquired in the recent battle, which he had been wearing on his waist. Switching on the terminal, a map showing the spread of the collapse cracks in real time appeared on the screen.",
	"727543": "I thought the crack was one ......?",
	"727544": "Pinching out and reducing the map showed a more extensive map, but did not show up to the outer boundary of the fissure.",
	"727545": "You don't mean to tell me that half of the ...... earth isn't already covered in the cracks of collapse?",
	"727546": "That's unlikely, but we can't assume that. This map must have been taken from someone else by those fugitives, and there is little chance that its contents are the most accurate data that reflects the current situation. ...... I mean, this is not what I wanted to show you.",
	"727547": "As she said this, she enlarged the map, scaling it from continent to city to town street.",
	"727548": "How do you know?",
	"727549": "...... yeah ...... the cracks of collapse ......",
	"727550": "Did you see the regularity of it?",
	"727551": "Well, it looks like the roads between the towns ...... and along the main roads within the towns are expanding ......? Why is that?",
	"727552": "I don't know. But I can tell you one thing. It is dangerous to take the main road. So we have to take small roads and go around.",
	"727553": "Dongdong!",
	"727555": "Okay, this is the power plant. But where's the gate? Oh, well. Porcupine, knock down that wall!",
	"727556": "Don!",
	"727557": "Damn, the walls are pretty thick. It's going to be hard to break through with these worn blades.",
	"727558": "Well, if it's this high, I can jump over it, and I'll figure out some way to do it after I jump over it.",
	"727559": "Kacha!",
	"727560": "Huh? Why did it open?",
	"727561": "Popo, did you open it?",
	"727562": "Yes, because it had the same structure as the one where I used to live.",
	"727563": "Oh, I see... my family worked at the power plant?",
	"727564": "Yes.",
	"727565": "Then Porcupine, turn on patrol mode. Scan the perimeter for enemies.",
	"727566": "-- [Bwin! -- [boing!",
	"727568": "Yeah ...... decay energy response is weak, and it looks like it's mostly safe.",
	"727569": "Well, if you do, ...... popo, you know about the void printer, don't you?",
	"727570": "Yeah. That's it, isn't it? ...... You're talking about the parent machine of a system that can print matter from nothing using the second law of decay energy, right?",
	"727571": "Yes, there's no point in hiding our objective. My next goal is to find the industrial void printers that are commonly deployed at power plants in town.",
	"727572": "The entire system of industrial void printers is about the size of a dozen buildings, but we're looking for the control room of the printer. The control room is small in comparison.",
	"727573": "You seem to know more about the structure of the power plant than I do, so maybe I'll ask you to come with me.",
	"727574": "The printer's control room. ...... Yeah, ...... I'm pretty sure I saw one when I was a little girl, so I kind of know what it's like.",
	"727575": "But it doesn't change the fact that you have to check each floor, because the location of the printer's control room will be somewhat different in each power plant.",
	"727576": "Either way, once we find the printer, we're halfway there. Let's go.",
	"727578": "Dongdong!",
	"727579": "Now it's unlocked. This is the security office.",
	"727580": "Yeah ...... okay. It still works. That's what I'd expect from a facility that collects power from a collapsing universe. The shielding for noise immunity is well done.",
	"727581": "Cold Steel quickly checked all the surveillance camera footage, checked the sensor reports, and turned his face toward us.",
	"727582": "Yeah, it looks like this power plant doesn't have the monster we saw earlier. We don't have much time, so let's start looking for them. We're looking for the control room of the void printer, you know what it looks like, right?",
	"727583": "Yes.",
	"727584": "Then let's go look for it right away.",
	"727588": "We wandered around the power plant, which was the size of a small town, looking for the control room for the imaginary printer.",
	"727589": "An hour or so after the start of the program, it became clear that this power plant was a Site-9 decay energy power plant.",
	"727590": "The terminal that Cold Iron obtained after defeating the Stigmata hunters contained an encyclopedia program that could run offline. Using it, he found that, at least prior to the giant crack, the Site-9 power plant was a collapsed beacon power plant.",
	"727591": "According to the encyclopedia's description, the Disintegration Beacon Power Plant was \"a facility where a Stigmata user or recipient drives a disintegration beacon, which sends matter into the disintegrating universe and converts it into clean energy called disintegration energy.",
	"727592": "Also, given the fact that this power plant has such a large work area, the following points were almost certain.",
	"727593": "Yes, the fact that an industrial void printer exists here.",
	"727595": "Oh my, this cafeteria has menus posted from before the power plant was scrapped.",
	"727596": "Do you have any food?",
	"727597": "Which one?",
	"727599": "No. Did they move all the food out?",
	"727600": "Haa......",
	"727602": "Two hours later, the search was over in section A and sections B1 and B2. Nothing was obtained except for the unfixable blue helmet worn by the cold iron.",
	"727604": "I don't want it. I still don't want it.",
	"727605": "Safety is not the first priority. We, who are doing things like picking up trash, have to work safely too.",
	"727606": "I really don't want it.",
	"727607": "I really didn't like wearing that helmet with the ears, so I escaped the cold steel trying to throw the helmet on me and hid myself using my abilities.",
	"727608": "That ability of yours is really useful.",
	"727610": "This is ......",
	"727611": "Yes.",
	"727612": "I and Cold Iron stood on a steel platform and looked toward the huge device, which was held in place by various equipment like a rocket just before launch.",
	"727613": "This is the disintegration beacon. After the will-controller is defeated and the disintegrating energy no longer causes an erosion of consciousness in the human body, and the disintegrating energy is transformed into a kind of clean energy--the beacon of disintegration.",
	"727614": "It is a masterpiece of human science and technology.",
	"727615": "A dream device to extract energy from another dimension where energy is unlimited.",
	"727616": "There must be a control room for the disintegration beacon nearby ...... Oh, there it is.",
	"727617": "Cold Steel found what appeared to be the control room of the disintegrating beacon. Perhaps worried that a stray bullet would destroy the internal structure, he tried to manage to open the door lock without using a gun.",
	"727618": "It's going to take some time. You've already been checked in this building, why don't you go for a walk at random.",
	"727619": "I understand.",
	"727620": "My helmet is broken. Did it fall off from somewhere?",
	"727621": "I wonder what's going on up there: ......?",
	"727622": "It's not likely to break at the ceiling-to-floor height here, which means someone brought it here.",
	"727623": "It's a stuffed bear.",
	"727625": "Nothing much to see here. Let's go.",
	"727626": "It's strange. I don't get the feeling that this is cute like I used to.",
	"727627": "It feels tasteless or dry. It feels as if it has faded away like ashes or dust.",
	"727628": "Having said that, there's nothing particularly interesting or interesting about this place.",
	"727629": "Most of the power plants were overseen and built by the corps after the war, so the buildings are almost similar in structure. There's a break room by the control room, and further back there's a hot water room.",
	"727630": "When I was little, I used to come to the power plant every day after school and wait for my mother to finish her work. So I know the structure of this place like the back of my hand.",
	"727631": "Across from the hot water room is the restroom, and further around the corner from the restroom is the rec room, and in front of the rec room is ......",
	"727633": "The front of the rec room is ...... from memory ...... from memory I think ...... maybe that was the one... ...",
	"727634": "Gigi......i......",
	"727635": "I opened that familiar and unfamiliar door.",
	"727636": "The air inside was murky. It must have not been ventilated for a long time. When I turned on the light, a huge device built into the wall appeared before me.",
	"727637": "Empty Pre...... cold--",
	"727638": "Turn off the lights.",
	"727640": "Sorry ...... can you please turn off the lights ...... well, too much glare.",
	"727641": "Oh, ...... yes.",
	"727642": "I turned off the light, but outside light was coming through the open door. Through that faint light I saw the person who spoke to me.",
	"727643": "He was shrinking in a dark corner. He seemed to be trembling from fear of the light. I couldn't see his face clearly, but I could guess from the clothes he was wearing and his helmet.",
	"727644": "Are you ...... an employee of this power plant?",
	"727645": "Oh ...... are you human?",
	"727646": "Yes, ...... yes.",
	"727647": "Really? Didn't that ...... human race, the human race, all become extinct?",
	"727648": "That ...... is all I know is that there are still human beings out there.",
	"727649": "I just like to sleep in places like this where people don't come and ...... skipped off to sleep, but when I woke up, everyone else, no one else was there. ......",
	"727650": "The cell phone signal, radio, and internet were all disconnected.",
	"727651": "I tried to gather my courage somehow, but you saw it too. The street outside was full of him everywhere.",
	"727652": "You mean you ...... have been living here since then?",
	"727653": "This door here leads to the beacon control room and the break room, and initially there was a lot of food there ......, but we've already finished that too.",
	"727654": "I think it was last week. No, it was last month. I've already forgotten.",
	"727655": "You've finished eating: ......",
	"727656": "What should I do?",
	"727657": "And you can't keep living like that forever.",
	"727658": "He's going to die eventually if we don't do something about it.",
	"727659": "I asked her to take me with her to the cold iron, but she wouldn't take me because ...... this person wouldn't be of any use to her, right?",
	"727660": "Use value ...... use value ....... By the way, does the fact that this guy was operating a void printer mean that he can use disintegrating energy?",
	"727661": "Um, let me ask you, do you have an implanted body of stigmata?",
	"727662": "Transplants: ......?",
	"727663": "I don't think he has an implanted body, judging from the fact that he doesn't seem to know what he's talking about. So is this guy a ...... stigmata user?",
	"727664": "'Popo! They've opened the door!\"",
	"727665": "From outside! Is there someone outside?",
	"727666": "I wonder if the cold iron is here!",
	"727667": "Um, okay. Please calm down and listen.",
	"727668": "That man out there is a very scary hunter. If he finds you, you may be in danger.",
	"727669": "So I will get her attention, and you can get out of here while I do.",
	"727670": "Dangerous People: ......",
	"727671": "That's right. I am also ...... actually like her prisoner. So please, if you see an opening, please run away.",
	"727672": "Yeah...... yeah......",
	"727673": "The person thought for a moment, then slowly stood up and walked toward me from the shadows.",
	"727674": "Yes, ...... yes, please run away quickly.",
	"727676": "Suddenly the person stopped walking.",
	"727677": "Why are you stopping?",
	"727678": "But what if you're a liar?",
	"727679": "It can be found at ......",
	"727680": "How could such an idea come out of nowhere?",
	"727681": "If I were in on it with the people out there, I wouldn't have to fool you in the first place. Please hurry up. If you keep waiting, you won't make it in time.",
	"727682": "Oh ...... sorry. I was wrong. I shouldn't have doubted you.",
	"727683": "He looked puzzled for a moment, but finally made up his mind and came toward me. But he immediately fell down.",
	"727684": "Sorry, I haven't walked in a while and my feet are completely numb. ......",
	"727685": "What? Popo, where are you?\"",
	"727686": "Yeah ...... I'll support you then.",
	"727687": "Thank you. ...... Thank you.",
	"727688": "The person's hand reached out from the shadows and I tried to grasp it. But still, why am I ...... risking so much for this person?",
	"727689": "Okay, I've got it, so I'll pull it.",
	"727690": "I took hold of the weakened person's hand and pulled with all my might.",
	"727691": "Thanks ......!",
	"727693": "Boom!",
	"727694": "You ...... ugh--!",
	"727695": "What does he want? What does he want? I can hold a gun with my other hand! Why is he covering my mouth with one hand? Where is his other hand? What does he have in his other hand?",
	"727696": "If you don't prevent it--yes. Ouch, my palm hurts. This is a screwdriver!",
	"727697": "I'm sorry, sorry, sorry--I'm so scared, I'm so scared. What if you've betrayed me? What if someone out there is thinking of killing me?",
	"727698": "We've already tried it. We all tried. We couldn't get out of the power plant, so we tried to go outside to get help. But in the end, nobody came back.",
	"727699": "Ugh ...... gosh gosh gosh ...... gosh gosh--",
	"727700": "But we ate up all the food. ...... right!",
	"727701": "Yes,...... so I started eating something else,...... and it was strange. I didn't feel lonely anymore, and I didn't feel scared.",
	"727702": "That being said, he was still weak and vulnerable. Perhaps because he was not strong enough to stab me to death with a screwdriver, he changed his methods and tried to choke me with his weight.",
	"727703": "I should just stay here all the time. Nothing happens here, and I feel safe. And everyone talks to me all the time.",
	"727704": "You should stay here forever too.",
	"727705": "His eyes glazed over. An eerie light emanated from his eyes. Why are his eyes so glaring when it's pitch black?",
	"727706": "Okay, I get it. This person is not a Stigmata user ...... and not a Recipient ...... This person is not a ...... This person is not a ...... This person is not a... ...",
	"727707": "You ......",
	"727708": "Ugh. ......",
	"727709": "A warm, raw liquid trickled down my face. Tears? Drool? Or sweat?",
	"727710": "It was none of those things. It was my blood.",
	"727711": "I felt like I was drowning,...... the sensation of not having enough oxygen gradually spreading to my brain.",
	"727712": "It must be. It's the only way. He is a \"creature of decay.",
	"727716": "I'm sorry, Mom.",
	"727717": "As my consciousness gradually faded, my mind raced back to the night I first met Kantetsu.",
	"727718": "That man is a stigmata hunter ...... and the only way to keep your mother from being killed is to give her the medicine.",
	"727719": "My mother wrapped herself in flimsy sheets and kept coughing.",
	"727720": "Paris ...... you ......",
	"727722": "Die in my place: ......",
	"727724": "As if by the last rays of the setting sun, my mother strained to reach out her skinny hand and place it on my face.",
	"727725": "I say to that hunter, ...... gobble gobble ...... \"I am the Stigmata user, I will give my life to save my mother's life.\"",
	"727726": "You are so cruel and ...... good. But you are a child who doesn't know how to move forward. ......",
	"727727": "Die for me at .......",
	"727728": "...... I guess I'm just going to die like this now.",
	"727729": "But I can't hate this person that much.",
	"727730": "I wonder why. No, I know why.",
	"727731": "If you might fail no matter what you do, it's better to do nothing. The feeling that the status quo will always be the same.",
	"727732": "I have the same thought. If I die like this, I won't have to go through the cruelty that is to come. I will not be used as a guinea pig for experiments. So maybe it is better that way.",
	"727733": "So this is good ...... this is good ...... this is good ............ .............................. ............",
	"727734": "Don ！！！！",
	"727736": "A thunderous roar pulled me back from the Sanzu River just in time.",
	"727737": "Ugh -- ouch -- that hurts!",
	"727738": "The kryptonite is off. ...... popo! You're not dead, are you? Answer me if you're alive!",
	"727739": "I felt like someone was grabbing my clothes. Someone pulled me and dragged me out the door.",
	"727740": "Does it hurt? It hurts, right? But it's okay, we're here. We'll be there!",
	"727741": "Finally, I opened my eyes and looked toward the darkness. Then that guy got down on all fours and quickly ran into the darkness.",
	"727742": "I shouted in a hurry:",
	"727743": "Be careful! He's a creature of decay--",
	"727744": "Dong-dong-dong!",
	"727745": "Cold Steel started shooting without hesitation. You could hear the bullets ricocheting in the darkness. That guy jumped and crawled along the wall, running away to another room.",
	"727746": "Popo, do you know what is in that room?",
	"727747": "That's the break room. There's a separate door to the break room, ...... and inside it is - the control room for the disintegrating beacon!",
	"727748": "--[Activate. --",
	"727749": "What's going on?",
	"727750": "It's an indescribable ...... strange feeling. A feeling as if a ship had run aground on a reef. A pounding sensation surged through me.",
	"727751": "The next moment, light flooded the hallway. I unconsciously turned around to see that huge piece of equipment emitting light at the end of the corridor, at the end of the stairs.",
	"727752": "Something is coming--",
	"727753": "Don!",
	"727754": "I'm going to run away.",
	"727756": "The eerie disintegrating creations from earlier filled the hallway. No matter how many of them we defeated, they kept appearing one after another, and there was no end in sight.",
	"727757": "Haa...... haa...... haa...... haa...... haa......",
	"727758": "Cold Iron ...... any suggestions?",
	"727759": "We don't have any big firepower weapons right now. If I had my stigmatic implant, I could have wiped them out long ago.",
	"727760": "Porcupine?",
	"727761": "It's not responding. I should be able to communicate at this distance, but the noise has intensified, probably because the disintegrating beacon has been activated, and I can't make contact at all.",
	"727762": "So you can't do anything about ...... then?",
	"727763": "It's all the fault of the disintegrating beacon ...... disintegrating beacon ...... oh?",
	"727764": "What, stare at ......",
	"727765": "I only have a substratum without an implant, but you are not a sacramental user to begin with.",
	"727766": "But I ...... don't have a particularly powerful sacrament, so I can't ...... defeat the enemy, you know?",
	"727767": "No, the disintegrating beacon can amplify the power of a weak sacral user. They may not be able to get to the control room, but if you can get to the energy chamber, I am sure they can manage.",
	"727768": "I'm going to throw you out with a bang. You go to the energy chamber in hiding and use the power of the amplified light stigmata to burn them down.",
	"727769": "Huh? What?",
	"727770": "Now the situation, I have no control over it. I'm leaving all the rest up to you!",
	"727771": "I can't do it!",
	"727772": "Even if I can't, I have to do it. I still have things to do. I can't stay stuck in this place!",
	"727773": "Hey hey hey hey ------",
	"727774": "Have a good day!",
	"727775": "They flew through the air. It was as if the monsters filling the hallway were spinning in circles. I had no choice but to disappear!",
	"727776": "Tons!",
	"727777": "Ho, I'm glad I threw it well on the flat: ......",
	"727778": "Now all we have to do is trust the popo.",
	"727779": "Won--!",
	"727780": "Come on you guys, let's dance around with me.",
	"727781": "Dong-dong-dong!",
	"727783": "I'm running out of ammo, and my Type 07 is overheating. Damn, now it's going to be a meat battle.",
	"727784": "D'onn--",
	"727785": "Whoa, looks like it worked.",
	"727787": "He's pretty good, isn't he?",
	"727792": "Is this the ...... I did?",
	"727793": "The light enveloped everything, and those guys were reduced to ashes.",
	"727794": "Did I have this kind of power?",
	"727795": "It's all quiet at once.",
	"727796": "Don!",
	"727798": "A sound came from the control room.",
	"727800": "Oh, you're here, aren't you? I turned off the beacon.",
	"727801": "When I entered the control room, Cold Iron was standing by the control panel. The creature of that collapse was ...... that worker lying on the floor. His chest was stained red.",
	"727802": "Okay, I've managed to clean up the mess. Now that we've found the control room for the printer, I'm going to concentrate on my work.",
	"727803": "Yeah ...... yeah ......",
	"727804": "Is this the end of ...... the ...... cleanup?",
	"727806": "G......Grrrl......",
	"727808": "That guy coughed up blood, and the blood came spurting out with bubbles. I immediately raised my gun at him.",
	"727809": "Gho...... gho gho gho ...... cold ...... hungry ......",
	"727810": "I have to pull the trigger ...... trigger.",
	"727811": "What are you ...... waiting for ......",
	"727812": "Ugh. ......",
	"727813": "Why don't you shoot me?",
	"727814": "It was obviously not because I was a good person. That is a lie. The gun I have is proof of that.",
	"727815": "My mother was eroded by the collapse and I stole this gun that day.",
	"727816": "After stealing the gun and returning home, I surreptitiously pointed it at my mother and attempted to pull the trigger.",
	"727817": "Because my mother was suffering very much. When she could still talk, my mother would say.",
	"727818": "My muscles are burning hot. Every bone is shattered, and it's like countless maggots are crawling around inside my head every time my heart beats, he said.",
	"727819": "That's why I stole the gun.",
	"727820": "But standing in front of the bed, I couldn't pull the trigger for the longest time. Because I didn't know.",
	"727821": "What will I do if my mother is gone?",
	"727822": "How can we exist in this world?",
	"727823": "I, like this man, was afraid of the answer to that question.",
	"727824": "As I was lost, suddenly my mother turned to me, took the gun from me, put it to her temple and tried to pull the trigger herself.",
	"727825": "But I saw it and took the gun from my mother.",
	"727827": "Yes, I am this kind of ...... self-centered, despicable child.",
	"727828": "I took the gun from my ...... mother to escape the problem of \"what do I do after this?\"",
	"727829": "I pretended to be a good girl, watching my mother get uglier and uglier by the day, doing nothing by her side. In the end, I just wanted to escape.",
	"727830": "Don ！！！！",
	"727831": "You weren't dead yet. I'm sure you're completely dead now. I must be getting old. I can't believe I don't have a better grasp of the situation.",
	"727832": "...... Is he really dead?",
	"727833": "If that's not enough, why don't I fire a couple more shots?",
	"727834": "Oh ...... So, I don't think I want that.",
	"727835": "...... seems like you're not in a very good mood.",
	"727836": "That's not true. ......",
	"727837": "Popo, watch me for a second.",
	"727839": "Watch and watch.",
	"727840": "What? What are they doing with the masks?",
	"727841": "OH!",
	"727843": "Suddenly, the cold iron vomited.",
	"727844": "Oooooo--oee--oee--oee--oee--oee--oee--oee!",
	"727845": "Gosh gosh gosh ...... came out!",
	"727846": "Three ...... USB memory stick-like objects came out of the mouth of the cold iron.",
	"727847": "Wow. ......",
	"727848": "Hehe, did I scare you?",
	"727849": "You can't eat these things .......",
	"727850": "I know that! It's an item you need at the end of the day, so you put it away in your stomach.",
	"727851": "Copy data ...... item?",
	"727852": "Yes, I know. These three are for rewriting the system of the void printer, various drawings of military equipment, and ...... Oh -- by the way, do you know <color=#DC143CFF>The War Maiden's Way of War</color>? color>?",
	"727853": "The War Maiden? The one from Norse mythology? Or one from history?",
	"727854": "It's the historical one. The forces that that organization called Tenmei or something like that had.",
	"727855": "I know what a battle maiden is, but then again, I've never heard of a battle maiden's warfare. It didn't even come up in the textbooks.",
	"727856": "You didn't study at a military school, so you won't find it in your textbooks. Look.",
	"727857": "Cold Iron inserted the USB memory stick into the void printer and pressed the return key several times. Then the machine started working.",
	"727858": "After defeating the Supervisor of Will, the Human Contracts Federation experienced a serious split into various factions. Finally, it split into the <color=#DC143CFF>World Federation of Contracts</color>, centered in New York, and the <color=#DC143CFF>Humanity Liberation League</color>, centered in Geneva.",
	"727859": "New York ...... Geneva. I'm pretty sure that's the name of a city in the Western Era.",
	"727860": "Yes, it was. The <color=#DC143CFF>Galan War</color> then led to a world war between the two sides called the <color=#DC143CFF>\"Aftermath War\"</color>.",
	"727861": "In order to prevent their own technological capabilities from being greatly surpassed by the enemy, both sides developed a strategy to exterminate the surviving war maidens of heavenly destiny in the intervals between the great battles.",
	"727862": "The war maidens gradually developed guerrilla tactics to prevent all of them from being captured or executed. And the war maidens are far more capable in individual battles than in group tactics.",
	"727863": "The women used blockchain and magnetic links to communicate their guerrilla warfare plans to each other. However, since the networks were overwhelmingly dominated by the Jinki-ren and Seiki-ren, most of the information they exchanged had to be indiscriminately uploaded to the Internet.",
	"727864": "Thus, the war maidens began to communicate with each other on anonymous Internet bulletin boards, exchanging information in a spy-like manner. This series of practices eventually coalesced into what came to be known as the War Maidens' War Method.",
	"727865": "This method of warfare then became the basis for guerrilla warfare in small groups and individuals by recipients who were not part of the Stigmata or military corps, which even covered techniques for making military equipment and other items using rewritable industrial void printers.",
	"727866": "-- [Product has been manufactured. Currently there are 13 products waiting to be manufactured] -- [Products have been manufactured.",
	"727867": "How is it done so fast? It's many times faster than I thought it would be.",
	"727868": "The way you just explained it, ......, the only reason you've been moving toward the giant crack so far is to find a power plant that the corps hasn't fortified, and the giant crack itself isn't the goal?",
	"727869": "You are partly right, but not entirely. Initially I had planned to head north to the strongholds effectively controlled by the Northern Army. But with the current spreading momentum of the collapse fissure, it is not possible for us to break through the fissure and end up on the northern front.",
	"727870": "So we have no choice but to turn around and go to the southern military base.",
	"727871": "But my first priority is to completely fix the equipment I'm wearing now, especially the armor with artificial muscles, so I guess you're right about that.",
	"727872": "That's what I meant: ......",
	"727873": "Would you like to see a list of equipment that can be made here? Maybe you'll find something you like? You did a great job this time, and if there is any weapon you want, I can make it for you.",
	"727874": "Yeah ......",
	"727875": "The backstory of the world was revealed to me one after another, and suddenly being asked such a question filled my head to the brim, and I was about to lose my ability to process it all. But as I was about to lose control, I suddenly realized something.",
	"727876": "Cold Iron, you ...... looked like I was having a hard time earlier, and that's why you told me so many things on purpose?",
	"727877": "What? Me? No way. It's just my personality from the beginning. I like to explain to people in detail about cause and effect and related things.",
	"727878": "Not a very appropriate character for a bad guy.",
	"727879": "Haha, I'll fix it next time then.",
	"727881": "Cold Iron, are you really a bad person?",
	"727882": "...... I don't know what you're talking about.",
	"727883": "Kangetsu replied while looking at the display.",
	"727884": "If I am not a bad person for selling an innocent girl to a dark scientist, then there is no one in the world who can be called a bad person.",
	"727886": "Okay, we are now fully restored! My armor is back to perfect condition, and I've got all the functional modules working.",
	"727887": "We've got weapon attachments, we've got projectile weapons ready to go. And it looks like we've got a smart core for the bike.",
	"727888": "Of course. And this! Here. It's an energy-charged revolver. You can have it. I wish I had an extra small beacon. Then you could have a real disintegrator energy weapon, since you're a sacramentalist.",
	"727889": "Like your Formula 07?",
	"727890": "Yes, this is an old buddy of mine.",
	"727891": "(I know you stole this from a museum. ......)",
	"727892": "Then we'll change destinations. We're going south on Route 247 to a Confederate-held territory. Let's move out!",
	"727893": "As Kantetsu loudly proclaimed this without regard for others, the motorcycle roared to life, its engine humming along with it.",
	"727894": "I shouldn't have had any curiosity on a journey whose ultimate goal was to sell myself short, but as I watched her, a thought inevitably popped into my head.",
	"727895": "The idea is that she would never sell me out.",
	"727896": "However, there was no evidence to support this idea, no matter where I looked. Everything she said and did might have been just a facade, deliberately trying to sound friendly, and in the first place, I myself could not believe in the idea.",
	"727897": "I also had this intuition. Perhaps she did not know that she was going to take such action. In any case, I could not believe that she would sell me out.",
	"727898": "But if you don't sell me out: ......",
	"727899": "If so, where is the goal for you?",
	"727900": "Night of the 7th day of the trip.",
	"727901": "Yeah ......",
	"727902": "Yeah ..................",
	"727903": "Mmmmmm. ........................!",
	"727904": "No. ......",
	"727905": "The word \"cape\" is missing somewhere.",
	"727906": "What are you mumbling to yourself?",
	"727907": "Popo, I'll let you pick. Which do you think is cooler, the word \"ledger\" or the word \"cape\"?",
	"727908": "Huh?",
	"727909": "What \"huh?\" What's that? Pick one quickly!",
	"727910": "Hmmm...maybe a ledger ......?",
	"727911": "Okay, so it's decided. The name of your primary skill is the sun book.",
	"727912": "What's that?",
	"727913": "It's the art of hiding. Come on, show it to the old woman.",
	"727914": "The cold iron claps his hands and chills him out.",
	"727915": "Ummm ......",
	"727916": "Is this okay?",
	"727917": "Yes, I named the power of the sacrament to hide my appearance the Book of Sun. So, can you make me disappear too?",
	"727918": "I think you can do it. ...... How about it?",
	"727919": "Have I become invisible? Wow, I really can't see both hands anymore! Well, disarm it a bit.",
	"727920": "Yeah, let's name this skill \"ledger of light\"! And the ability to make objects invisible. ...... Then try to make the hedgehog disappear, fast!",
	"727922": "Let's make this a phantom book. And the one that takes away light within a certain range, we don't need to do that one right now. I'm going to make that one a heavenly book.",
	"727923": "Wait a minute. What's the point in doing that? Why not make it something you can hear and understand? If you're going to hide yourself, why bother calling it a daybook when you can just make it self-transparent or something?",
	"727924": "You don't understand. Think about it. For example, if we ran into a very strong enemy and I didn't have time to protect you, or if I couldn't manage without your support, wouldn't it be better to have a code name for your skills?",
	"727925": "Hmmm.........I think I understand somehow.........If you tell me to be \"self-transparent\" in such a situation, the enemy will hear it and immediately know what I am capable of, right?",
	"727926": "That's right, it's all about getting the upper hand in the fight. Remember this. It is the daylight that you hide, and it is the light that your friends hide.",
	"727927": "It's the book of illusions that hides obstacles, and it's the book of heaven that takes away light from within range. Oh, and it's the book of night that hides the enemy, how about that?",
	"727928": "Understood, but still ......",
	"727929": "It's my skill and I, I'd like to name it myself.",
	"727930": "Whoa, I like your positivity. So, tell me one of your candidates for the old lady?",
	"727931": "Cold Iron is lying on the ground, looking relaxed and eating a bag of potato chips with his hand in it.",
	"727932": "Ummm ......",
	"727933": "Ummm ..................",
	"727934": "Hmmm ........................... ...",
	"727935": "Hiding yourself is ...... that ...... umm ......",
	"727936": "Glass...... lapis lazuli...... crystal...... crystal mode......",
	"727937": "Lame, even a third-rate game wouldn't be named that. You might mistake it for a charging method or something.",
	"727938": "Have you ever played in a game too or something?",
	"727939": "Do you think people born in the West are cavemen or something?",
	"727940": "I, you know, when I was younger, I didn't have many friends and I played games all the time ......",
	"727941": "I feel like ...... is lying somewhere?",
	"727942": "I can't help it, I have to admit, I used to play games and have fun until a huge crack appeared and shut down the internet: ......",
	"727943": "Oh, yes, my favorite side-scrolling shooter game--",
	"727944": "Yes, we could name it after a game!",
	"727945": "You're not going to listen to my memoirs at all, are you?",
	"727946": "We are pleased to announce ........................... .....................!",
	"727947": "Flash form--how's that?",
	"727948": "That's even more lame, rejected.",
	"727949": "Morning of the 13th day of the trip.",
	"727950": "B-b-b-b-but--",
	"727951": "The winds of the wilderness blow against the bike.",
	"727952": "The bike is groaning.",
	"727953": "How's it going?",
	"727954": "No good.",
	"727956": "How's it going?",
	"727957": "It's still no good.",
	"727959": "What do you think?",
	"727960": "It's still no good. ...... Oh, here it comes!",
	"727961": "Finally, a mark appeared on the cell phone given to me by Cold Iron, which captured the signal, although very small.",
	"727962": "Soon the sound of a mass SMS arrival rang out.",
	"727963": "Well, we're finally connected.",
	"727964": "Kee--",
	"727965": "Cold Steel immediately stopped his motorcycle, received his cell phone, and checked his mailbox.",
	"727966": "Yeah ......",
	"727967": "Excuse me?",
	"727968": "It seems that at least the ...... people's government still exists.",
	"727969": "Ho......",
	"727970": "I breathed an involuntary sigh of relief when I heard that the social organization of humanity still existed far from the giant fissure, although it had nothing to do with my own fate.",
	"727971": "I'll take a look at a few more: ...... Yeah, these are all the messages sent at once. They seem to receive them on their own when they come to this area.",
	"727972": "Southern Legion Evacuation Information, Eastern Legion Evacuation Information, Eastern Legion Evacuation Information, Eastern Legion Evacuation Information ...... Advertisement for Eastern Legion Brokerage? Recruitment ads for Eastern Legion?",
	"727973": "All you do is advertise ads ads ads. The Eastern Legion is awesome, sending us nothing but ads when we need help. Damn you Ryan Kumaré!",
	"727974": "The cold iron showed his anger as he pointed to the sun.",
	"727975": "From what I hear, <color=#DC143CFF>Ryan Kumaré<color=#DC143CFF>, the Commander of the Legion of the East</color>, is not on Earth. The sun is his palace, they say.",
	"727976": "Any info on the First Corps? Nothing about the Western and Northern armies either. ...... What about the internet? The internet's still not connecting either.",
	"727977": "Cold Steel, who had been quietly watching the SMS, eventually turned off his cell phone and sighed.",
	"727978": "So how was ......? How's the world?",
	"727979": "If you want to know anything, I'll tell you. First, human societies do still exist. At least the Southern and Eastern Legions exist.",
	"727980": "That's the rebel force that betrayed the command headquarters of the ...... Corps, right?",
	"727981": "A win is a win in the human civil war. As things stand now, it seems that the First Corps, which was defending the center, has already been defeated.",
	"727982": "With that, Cold Steel turned his face and continued to drive his motorcycle. The wilderness wind was blowing again.",
	"727983": "The evacuation info SMS says that further up route 247 you'll see Site-16.",
	"727984": "That place is not yet under the effective control of the Southern Legion, but refugee camps and various infrastructures have been established there.",
	"727985": "So that's our next stop.",
	"727987": "Giggle, giggle, giggle...",
	"727988": "We're here.",
	"727989": "We parked Porcupine outside of town, and Cold Iron and I rode our bikes into Site-16.",
	"727990": "People's voices, which were only faintly audible when they first entered the town, gradually became louder as they entered the city.",
	"727991": "Voices of peddlers, arguing, bickering, fans of electronic equipment. The various sounds echoed through the air like ......",
	"727992": "It's as if the town itself has started breathing ......",
	"727993": "The town breathes, it might eat people. We have to be careful not to be swallowed by the town.",
	"727994": "Parking her motorcycle by a certain bar, Kantetsu made a few phone calls. After a few twists and turns, she was able to find the Swan Hotel she was looking for.",
	"727995": "A lone man was at the hotel reception and noticed our arrival.",
	"727996": "Thanks, I hope Swan will fly with me.",
	"727997": "...... What?",
	"727998": "I'll say it again. I hope Swan flies with me.",
	"727999": "My apologies!",
	"728000": "The man quickly left the place and ran toward the kitchen.",
	"728001": "Hey, these guys seem to be a lot more polite than before, don't they? Very efficient?",
	"728002": "These guys?",
	"728003": "Oh, nothing. So, Popo, what do you think of the War Maiden?",
	"728004": "What do you think? I think the war maidens have been wiped out.",
	"728005": "Well, assuming that's the case, ...... wait. As I recall, they don't hire men for reception here.",
	"728006": "Saying this, Kantetsu ran to the kitchen and returned a short time later.",
	"728007": "I think he was a sneak thief. The Swan Hotel is closed.",
	"728008": "What's wrong with ...... if you're closed?",
	"728009": "That's not the case. ...... and you're not old enough for it anyway. ......",
	"728010": "Cold Steel, looking disappointed, uttered unintelligible words and left the hotel with me, returning again to the vicinity of the bar we had just left.",
	"728012": "After worrying and thinking for a while, Kantetsu said the following:",
	"728013": "I have just contacted the information network of scar hunters in this town, and I have found two sources who are interested in buying you. One is a research team belonging to the Southern Scar Bureau, and the other is a southern scar military aristocrat.",
	"728014": "Of the two, I chose the latter. Then ...... if you're lucky, you might become a Stigmata Knight in the Southern Army, or ...... if you're lucky.",
	"728015": "What if I'm unlucky?",
	"728016": "I wonder if it would be a subject for another study.",
	"728017": "So ......",
	"728018": "From now on, you stand right here. And if things get dangerous, you get on your bike and get out of there right away. There is no interference from disintegrating energy here, so all remote commands will work, and I will be able to tell you what's going on.",
	"728019": "I'm going to go make contact with your buyer now.",
	"728020": "She did not wait for me to say so, but melted into the wave of people.",
	"728024": "I don't understand.",
	"728025": "This is the same as telling me to run away from her.",
	"728026": "But even if I wanted to escape, where on earth would I run to if I was penniless and had nowhere to hide and no one to know?",
	"728027": "And if you don't run away, you'll just end up with an already predetermined ending, but you don't know what horrible things will happen if you do. ...... Then there's no reason to run away.",
	"728028": "But still, it's her who doesn't make sense. She seemed very lost, but if she wanted to let me go, why didn't she just say so and let me go?",
	"728029": "What the hell were they thinking?",
	"728030": "Move, move, move!",
	"728031": "Ugh!",
	"728032": "Suddenly, someone bumped into me from behind. When I turned around, there was a middle-aged woman with a face that looked listless.",
	"728033": "Is there something wrong with--",
	"728034": "The woman continued to push me without regard. Behind her followed many others. Dressed in old clothes, they pushed in one direction, and I, caught in the wave, had no choice but to squirm and move with the flow of people in order to avoid being knocked down and trampled.",
	"728035": "What the hell is this?",
	"728036": "Move, quickly, grab my hand.",
	"728037": "Someone suddenly called out to me in a loud voice. Before I had time to answer it, I was grabbed by the person's hand and pulled out of the muddy stream of people.",
	"728038": "Be careful from then on.",
	"728039": "After saying this, the person left.",
	"728040": "Thanks ......? But still, what was that about earlier?",
	"728041": "Turning toward the wave of people, they had already stopped advancing. Gathered in a somewhat open square, they suddenly knelt down.",
	"728042": "Then he started mumbling and praying.",
	"728043": "What in the world are you doing at ......?",
	"728044": "Just a bunch of fools.",
	"728045": "A person nearby replied. I turned around and saw a man dressed like a beggar huddled in the corner, looking at them.",
	"728046": "A few months ago, a rumor started to spread in the south. Some people started to spread the rumor that a miracle had occurred at Site-01 in the south.",
	"728047": "Miracle?",
	"728048": "Yes, a miracle. A huge monument descended from the heavens and stopped the expansion of the dead zone.",
	"728049": "Dead zone? Are you referring to the cracks of collapse by any chance?",
	"728050": "You're a smart girl, aren't you? They, all the Sacred Scar users, are talking about how the people of the world can be saved if they all travel to the Holy Land and gather at the Site-01 Monument.",
	"728051": "All the sacramentalists? Everyone will be saved?",
	"728052": "It's just a rumor. Fools don't know about true miracles.",
	"728053": "A true miracle? Does that mean the rumor is false information?",
	"728054": "That's right. I believe only in the true God. He is far gone, but He still gives me the courage to get through the lonely and hard times.",
	"728055": "By God do you mean ...... science?",
	"728056": "What are you talking about? My God is the Supervisor of Will. I wish that He would come down to this world again and wash away all our sins. The current calamity happened because mankind defied the Supervisor of Will.",
	"728057": "Hearing the oddball's outlandish logic gave me chills and I quickly left the place.",
	"728058": "Messed up things ......",
	"728059": "I hobbled away from that magical place.",
	"728064": "Yeah, we made it back to where we could see the Swan Hotel. Thank God, I almost got lost.",
	"728065": "If you turn the corner at the end of the street, you'll see the bar where the bikes are parked. ...... Oh, no?",
	"728067": "I noticed the person who had pulled me out of the crowd earlier was pondering over the merchandise in a nearby store.",
	"728069": "(I should talk to him and thank him?)",
	"728070": "I looked at the description on the door of the store. The store appears to be a pawn shop where various items can be exchanged for the currency circulating in the effective southern territories. Inside the store are mechanical watches, necklaces, and other accessories.",
	"728071": "I still don't want to do it.",
	"728072": "Excuse me, young lady there, but may I have a word?",
	"728073": "What? Wa ...... me?",
	"728074": "Yeah, sorry, do you have a minute?",
	"728075": "I was a little scared, but I decided to think that there were many people around and that even if something happened to me, I could just hide and escape.",
	"728076": "Can I help you?",
	"728077": "I approached the store, but kept a short distance away so that I could escape quickly if something went wrong.",
	"728078": "What is it?",
	"728079": "Yeah.",
	"728080": "The man showed me two necklaces.",
	"728081": "With a woman of your age, which necklace would she like better?",
	"728082": "You were wondering what to give as a gift, you surprised me.",
	"728083": "It was supposed to be a topic very close to my daily life, but for a while, for some reason, I didn't really feel it.",
	"728084": "What kind of person are you giving this to ......?",
	"728085": "My work colleague ...... or more accurately, the younger generation of kids at home.",
	"728086": "Is it a co-worker's kid?",
	"728087": "Yes, ...... would I be able to ...... the one there or something like that?",
	"728088": "I pointed to a necklace hanging elsewhere. It was a silver necklace with emeralds.",
	"728089": "I see, women think these necklaces are beautiful.",
	"728090": "(No, it's just that the two you chose are weird. One looks like a child's toy, the other like a torture device.)",
	"728091": "I understand. Thanks.",
	"728092": "The soft-spoken, cold-looking man took the necklace I recommended and walked toward the cash register.",
	"728093": "Speaking of which, this guy's outfit is somewhere ......",
	"728094": "Oi--po-po-po--!\"",
	"728095": "I heard Cold Steel's voice coming from outside the store. I turned around and saw her calling from across the street.",
	"728096": "I see you're back at .......",
	"728098": "Did you want to buy something?",
	"728099": "No. The company is not a member of the National Association of Schools and Colleges of America.",
	"728100": "Well, let's just go hungry for now.",
	"728101": "We walked for a while and came back to the bar where the bikes were parked - and then we were back at the bar.",
	"728102": "When he opened the door and entered, the inside was filled with lively voices and the aroma of food. I reached into my cold-iron pocket and offered two bills issued by the Southern Army. He had spent quite a bit of money gathering information in town and was probably the last money left.",
	"728103": "The bartender offered us two drinks and a plate of bread. We sat down right next to the TV.",
	"728104": "It's the only one I can afford to have on hand. Let's eat.",
	"728105": "When she said that, I finally realized that she had ordered a meal for me alone. ...... Was this her last meal for me, who would soon be sold out? It's a little meager for that.",
	"728106": "(Bread, huh? I don't like bread that much. ......)",
	"728107": "But when I took a bite, the bread was unexpectedly very tasty. It was really delicious. I didn't know there was such a delicious bread.",
	"728108": "(Now that I think about it, the last time I ate ...... properly cooked food was more than six months ago. ......)",
	"728109": "It's kind of strange. A little over six months ago, I was a semi-senior high school student, in an air-conditioned room all the time, and I didn't think for a minute that anything unusual would happen: ......",
	"728110": "I can't believe that now even ordinary bread like this is so delicious.",
	"728111": "Cold iron...... you should eat some too--",
	"728112": "When I looked up at her after saying this, she was concentrating on the TV content.",
	"728113": "-- [Today we invite Thomas Kane, spokesman for the World Construction Corps and the Eastern Legion, to speak with us. I would like to ask you: ......]--",
	"728114": "It appears to be a talk show with invited guests. The host, who is from the Southern Command, asks sensitive questions in rapid succession, and the guests sometimes look difficult.",
	"728115": "--[As already mentioned, the various treaties between the respective groups, as well as those with the First Corps, are free market based trade actions, and do not in themselves represent the attitude of the Eastern Corps itself.] --",
	"728116": "-- [Does the trade action here include allowing the First Corps to take over the defense of the Eastern Army?] --",
	"728117": "-- [It is not possible to completely isolate the ...... situation in that way, and I don't think it can be discussed in a blanket way. The issue of defense of the Eastern Legion has been a long time coming, and I think it has to be debated carefully ......]--[I think it has to be debated carefully ......",
	"728118": "As I listened to the program while eating bread, I could sort of grasp what had happened so far.",
	"728119": "According to what was on television, it seemed certain that the First Corps had been defeated in the world's civil wars. However, the process was not as simple as the First Corps being on the decline and finally being beaten.",
	"728120": "Not long after the cracks of that collapse - the area now commonly referred to as the dead zone - began to expand, the First Corps had won a total and thorough victory that was irrefutable.",
	"728121": "Therefore, the upper echelons of the Southern Army, which had been hostile to the First Corps, attempted to divide their forces and wage a guerrilla war, while the Eastern Corps was about to concede defeat and surrender.",
	"728122": "But then, for whatever reason, the phase of the war was quickly reversed in a short period of time, and the Southern Army, which had been in a hostile posture, invaded Hermann, the effective center of the First Corps and the capital of the world.",
	"728123": "This turned the Eastern Army, which had planned to surrender, into complete clowns.",
	"728124": "So the spokespersons of the Eastern Command had to be passive in this TV program. It was clear from the outset that if the Internet were to be restored, people would post derisive comments on anonymous message boards.",
	"728125": "(But this show is funny and quite entertaining.)",
	"728126": "I reached out to take a piece of bread while watching the program, but there was nothing there anymore. Before I knew it, I had finished eating.",
	"728127": "Cold Iron seems to be planning to watch a few more programs. It must be very important for her to understand the current situation.",
	"728128": "(Chug a drink to pass the time.)",
	"728129": "Bartender, one B-set, please.\"",
	"728130": "(Does this voice sound familiar?)",
	"728131": "It's not good for you to eat so little at such a young age. You ordered it, so eat it.",
	"728132": "(That's the guy who bought the necklace earlier.)",
	"728133": "Don't be shy. Consider it a thank you for helping me pick out a necklace.",
	"728134": "Popo, who is this guy?",
	"728135": "He was at the store.",
	"728136": "This girl helped me out when I was picking out a gift. I hope I can repay you in some small way.",
	"728137": "Yes, ...... if you don't eat it, you're missing out and you can do whatever you want.",
	"728138": "Cold Steel looked at them for a moment and then started watching a TV program again.",
	"728139": "Yes, I think so.",
	"728140": "Soon a griddle with beef, broccoli and pasta as garnish arrived. The sauce was poured generously over the top, and the smell of the savory meat and the heat were palpable.",
	"728141": "(It's kind of like that when it's this big--a last meal.)",
	"728142": "I moved my knife and fork with a feeling of excitement that I am sure this uncle would not understand.",
	"728143": "（Oooh..! This texture - it must be synthetic meat. But still delicious!)",
	"728144": "I couldn't help but devour it.",
	"728145": "Manager, two more B sets, please.",
	"728146": "Don't choke on it. It's just a meal. I'll take care of the payment.",
	"728147": "This uncle ...... was actually kind ......",
	"728148": "Uncle, I bet you don't realize what kind of a relationship I have with Cold Steel. I guess that's understandable. We don't look like traffickers and trafficked for all intents and purposes.",
	"728149": "But ...... if I ask for help, will this person help me?",
	"728150": "What's wrong? Is there something you want to say?",
	"728151": "I ......",
	"728152": "Hm?",
	"728153": "I was startled when Kantetsu sounded suspicious. Could she have realized something?",
	"728154": "--[Ladies and gentlemen, television viewers, we interrupt this program to go live now.] --",
	"728155": "-- [The Fifth Commander-in-Chief of the World Construction Corps will speak.] --",
	"728156": "The fifth commander-in-chief? Wasn't the current commander of the defeated First Corps the fourth?",
	"728158": "-- [The <color=#DC143CFF>Lavinia Avignon</color>, Fifth Commander-in-Chief of the World Construction Corps, First Marshal of the World Corps and Commander of the Southern Legion, hereby declares...] --",
	"728160": "The cold steel was somewhat forward. He seemed to be paying very close attention to the story.",
	"728161": "-- [The command headquarters of the Corps passed a proposed change in the content of the charter today. Effective today.　]--",
	"728162": "--All individuals and organizations that speak or act in the name of the First Legion are considered \"anti-humanity\". All individuals and organizations that cooperate with the First Legion are to be considered as [......]--.",
	"728163": "-- [shall be regarded as persons of the anti-humanity, opposed to the World Building Corps, deprived of the right to life recognized by the Charter, and may be immediately shot to death.] -- [and",
	"728164": "What do you mean?",
	"728165": "I looked at Kantetsu with a puzzled expression. Kantetsu remained silent, staring at the TV screen.",
	"728166": "Yes, two B sets.",
	"728167": "Oh, I'm sorry.",
	"728168": "Two more sets of beef were laid out. The first plate of pasta was not yet finished, and I felt extremely extravagant.",
	"728169": "(I have to thank my uncle. ......)",
	"728170": "I lifted my head and looked at my uncle.",
	"728171": "I noticed he was staring at the cold iron. I wonder what's going on_.",
	"728172": "Oh, I'm sorry. Miss. Actually, I still have some things to do. Don't mind if I do.",
	"728173": "He must have noticed my gaze, because he turned away from the cold iron and stood up.",
	"728174": "If you'll excuse me first.",
	"728175": "Yeah ...... yes.",
	"728176": "The uncle got up, put the money on the counter and walked toward the door.",
	"728177": "Sir, please wait. You forgot your jacket.",
	"728178": "As he was leaving the bar, one of the waiters stopped him with his jacket.",
	"728180": "Then the uncle looked very surprised.",
	"728181": "At that moment, I felt as if time had slowed down tremendously.",
	"728182": "He reached for my waist --------!",
	"728183": "Don ！！！！",
	"728185": "The uncle collapsed with a sound--",
	"728186": "What, what's wrong, what happened?",
	"728187": "Let's go!",
	"728188": "I felt someone grab my clothes and tug me. The counter, the fallen uncle, and the steaks on the griddle were quickly moving away from me - and then I was gone.",
	"728189": "The sound of chairs and tables toppling over was followed by the sound of windowpanes breaking. Then came the sound of the wind breaking--",
	"728190": "Motorcycle, start it up--",
	"728191": "What the hell happened?",
	"728192": "The wind was blowing and the bar was getting smaller and smaller. My mind was very confused and I was trying desperately to figure out what had happened.",
	"728193": "Uncle realizes he has a jacket...... jacket, reaches for the gun, but the cold steel is much faster...... jacket...... jacket! Jacket--",
	"728194": "Is that a Southern Army man's jacket?",
	"728195": "But what's the point of that? Why would you shoot a Confederate just because you saw him? No, it's not that, it's because your uncle noticed something? But where? When? You don't mean when Cold Steel was watching the news?",
	"728196": "But what's the news about? News about the First Corps? Is there a connection between the Cold Steel and the First Corps? If so, what's the connection?",
	"728197": "Don!",
	"728199": "The wall of the bar tilted as it was pushed strongly outward and the bricks scattered and cracked noisily. The man, a Southern Army man, looked around with a blank expression on his face, then, after taking a bearings, he followed me and the cold steel at a great speed.",
	"728200": "Bad luck. I never thought I'd run into a hunter.",
	"728201": "Hunters?",
	"728202": "I felt my body floating in the air. The cold steel threw me onto the running motorcycle. She jumped up as she ran, grabbed the handlebars of the bike, and opened the throttle to full throttle. The bike roared to a halt and ran out of town--",
	"728203": "The hunters of the collapse are the elite of the southern army. One means there are five or six nearby. ......",
	"728205": "They are a special unit that carries out group missions to kill sacramentalists.",
	"728206": "Don ！！！！",
	"728209": "The motorcycle roared off the road and into the wilderness.",
	"728210": "Kii--!",
	"728211": "No, they can't. There is no way they can escape, because the hunters are in special vehicles that can move much faster than ordinary military vehicles.",
	"728212": "Then what do we do?",
	"728213": "We have to wait and fight.",
	"728215": "Cold iron breathed deeply.",
	"728216": "It may be hard for me to win now that I have no sacrament. If I lose, you surrender. If you do, there may still be a chance of survival.",
	"728218": "You're going to ambush us in the woods ahead of you. ...... Flaming Shadow, accelerate. Change to patrol mode.",
	"728219": "--Copy that...",
	"728220": "I turned on the communication line while maneuvering the dedicated hunting weapons.",
	"728221": "Hound 01 contacted Hound Platoon. We have found what appears to be a remnant of the 1st Corps and are currently in pursuit. The coordinates have been sent and you are to assemble immediately.]",
	"728222": "--Roger that, Raja.",
	"728223": "-- [Well, another mission. Dad?] --",
	"728224": "-- [Me and my sister Arashine will be on our way soon.] --",
	"728225": "The other party has a Stigmatic Implanted Body Base that appears to be a Type 15. It is an antiquated device, but its energy level is top class. It is unclear what kind of sacramental abilities it supports, but it appears that it is probably not equipped with a sacramental implant at this time.",
	"728226": "That said, she may possibly ...... be on her guard anyway.",
	"728227": "Over. This one continues to track its prey.",
	"728228": "The flame shadow moves at high speed and the trees quickly disappear behind it. It's almost there. From the speed of his reaction at the bar, he must be a sharp guy, and he must surely know that he can't escape from the dedicated collapsing hunter vehicle in that vehicle.",
	"728229": "So they must be waiting and fighting. To try to defeat me--",
	"728230": "I see a light in the distance! But I can react even before the sound of gunfire--",
	"728231": "Don!",
	"728232": "Slash!",
	"728233": "I swung my great sword and the bullet split in half quite easily. I could clearly see the two bullet trajectories in the woods behind me.",
	"728234": "Using live ammunition to launch a surprise attack. I guess he doesn't have a stigmatic implant - after all!",
	"728235": "Bingo!",
	"728237": "Don!",
	"728239": "One minute ago, back in the day.",
	"728240": "You're just going to lay low like this, aren't you?",
	"728241": "Yes.",
	"728242": "Cold Iron held up his rifle and indicated so without looking at us. He must have caught the hunter in the center mark of the rifle's scope the whole time.",
	"728243": "Don!",
	"728244": "A bullet was fired - as expected of an elite who can kill a Stigmata user. With just one swing of the sword, the bullet was cut in half.",
	"728245": "I'm stuck.",
	"728246": "It was a great opponent, to be sure, but we were able to trap him. That bullet was not fired by us, but by a porcupine that was discreetly stopped in the opposite direction.",
	"728247": "And in a blind spot, invisible to the hunters, the Type 07 Disintegrating Energy Rifle, which had been rendered invisible by my ability, had finished its energy charge and was now fully loaded and fired.",
	"728248": "Don!",
	"728249": "The entire body leaned back as if the hunter had taken a direct hit from a large hammer.",
	"728250": "Bingo!",
	"728251": "You beat it!",
	"728252": "For a moment I was a little worried about the hunter.",
	"728253": "No, ...... that's not right. The body did lean back but something is wrong. How did that guy not fall off that motorcycle-like vehicle?",
	"728254": "And that ride is running all the way toward us!",
	"728255": "Funny, isn't it? What is this ability ...... no way - no, because that stigmata wasn't supposed to have been analyzed yet, was it?",
	"728256": "The man looked like a rock star or something who was ...... just singing rust--and he was.",
	"728257": "With one foot on the front part of the bike, my body was leaning backward in an unnatural way - it was impossible. Given the inertia of physics, there was no way he could not have tumbled down in that position. How could he continue to stand on the bike?",
	"728258": "Is he already dead? Is he already dead and his leg is stuck somewhere on the bike?",
	"728259": "No, ...... not--!",
	"728260": "That guy isn't even standing on the bike to begin with, he's floating in the air. The great sword he's holding is spewing fire and he's moving with the propulsion of ...... that's more propulsive and faster than a dedicated hunter's bike! So--",
	"728261": "You caught up with the bike that went ahead of you, didn't you?",
	"728262": "Oh, that guy - is he flying by fire control?",
	"728263": "I'm not kidding. ...... You need to do something like that. ......!",
	"728264": "Both the motorcycle and the great sword growled and approached at a furious pace. The man who had been standing on the motorcycle gradually and slowly raised himself up and put the sword to his shoulder - and the sword to his shoulder.",
	"728265": "That's about the only thing that's going to bring me down.",
	"728266": "You were a user of the Stigmata of Fire.",
	"728267": "Don!",
	"728268": "As the hunter dragged the sword, the sword's blade freely exhaled flames like a thrust deflector engine, generating enormous thrust. And it sent the sword's wielder flying upward in a split second--a huge thrust.",
	"728270": "Then - he swung his sword down with great vigor!",
	"728271": "Kin!",
	"728272": "Ugh. ......!",
	"728273": "Since it was difficult to use a rifle to block a large sword at this distance, Kantetsu used his agile reflexes to intercept the sword attack.",
	"728274": "Slow!",
	"728275": "Don!",
	"728276": "The cold steel threw the hunter into the air, pulled out a short-tube shotgun, aimed it at the man's chest, and pulled the trigger.",
	"728277": "But the hunter's movements were faster than hers. His actions were quite different from those of an ordinary fighter. He would use the power of his flame stigmata to instantly accelerate any part of his body and close the distance after securing a vantage point.",
	"728278": "Uu......",
	"728279": "The probability of a cold iron win seems extremely low, given the circumstances. The only possibility left for them to win is--",
	"728280": "There is nothing but wrangling!",
	"728281": "That's right. There is no other way but to engage in a scuffle. The only way to get close enough to use that impossibly fast flaming great sword is to get close enough to make it impossible to use it. Even if Kintetsu is skilled in the use of weapons, it is the only way to win now.",
	"728282": "Shun!",
	"728283": "What is it?",
	"728284": "At that moment, Kantetsu disappeared from the presence of the hunter. Even though there was no instruction from Kantetsu, I had unconsciously used my ability to make Kantetsu disappear.",
	"728285": "There's a lot of gaps!",
	"728286": "The cold iron grabbed the hunter by the neck. Victory is at hand--",
	"728287": "You're a wimp.",
	"728289": "I didn't know what the hell had happened. He was about to seize victory by the scruff of the neck when his right hand suddenly snapped back without effort.",
	"728290": "Ugh!",
	"728291": "What is this? I'm beginning to understand what happened as soon as it happened. At that moment, the hunter broke ...... Cold Iron's right hand using a joint technique!",
	"728292": "My weapon, the Stigmata of Fire, is also good at close combat. I can accelerate two steps while in the air, control the battlefield with the power of flames, and close the distance between me and my opponent in an instant.",
	"728293": "With that said, he easily caught Kantetsu's left arm with his artistic skill and now snapped his left hand.",
	"728294": "I am a soldier. Do you think I would create a gap in my system of operations?",
	"728295": "Ugh--",
	"728296": "With both of his hands broken, Kantetsu lost his balance and almost fell over. The hunter turned his palms upward with a blank look on his face, and fire erupted from his hands, the momentum of which instantly brought his body into a low position, and he went straight to take both of Cold Iron's legs. ......",
	"728297": "You're giving up--",
	"728298": "And the cold steel broke both legs as well.",
	"728299": "That's as far as it goes.",
	"728300": "Boom.",
	"728301": "The cold iron ...... of the cold iron ...... has broken all my hands and legs!",
	"728302": "Without seeming to pay any attention to my surprise, he put his sword behind his back and gave Kantetsu a swift kick to the jaw, knocking him unconscious.",
	"728303": "This is what you do to an enemy who can manipulate disintegrating energy.",
	"728304": "Is this the operational capability that the hunters of the ...... collapse have?",
	"728305": "Hu ......",
	"728306": "Hound 01 to platoon. Target eliminated. I was able to come early for post-mortem pickup. Over.",
	"728307": "Am I ...... going to be killed?",
	"728308": "What's going to happen to me ......?",
	"728309": "The hunter took one look at me but did not answer the question. Then he pressed some button and started communicating with someone, and a screen appeared in front of him.",
	"728310": "............ I'm in a meeting right now, what's going on?",
	"728311": "We have captured what we believe to be a VIP of the First Legion. He has the highest power base but is not equipped with a stigmatic implant. Also, an underage female was working with him.",
	"728312": "You mean the division commander class base, right? I didn't think there were still such people ...... or maybe there are. I understand. That person must be executed immediately.",
	"728313": "So what about the underage girls who are with you?",
	"728314": "Is she <color=#DC143CFF>[Princess]</color>?",
	"728316": "They should not be the target of VIPs because of their different height, hair color, and build.",
	"728317": "...... minor......",
	"728318": "All right, listen up. Among the remnants of the First Legion, there may be a scar user who can change a person's appearance, or someone with that kind of technology. Take every precaution here and execute the girl immediately. Bring the body back and deal with it discreetly.",
	"728319": "Please wait. The first thing to do is to check--",
	"728320": "Don't say this and don't say that, just follow orders. Think about it. Think how many people would die if you were to let <color=#DC143CFF>[Princess]</color> escape because of your petty passions.",
	"728321": "This will be a great accomplishment for you if you do it right this time, so don't disobey orders. I'm going to go now.",
	"728323": "The hunter hung up.",
	"728324": "Then he looked at me with a depressed look.",
	"728325": "An icy, chilly sensation enveloped me in an instant.",
	"728327": "This is another duty that must be fulfilled as a soldier.",
	"728328": "I have no taste for torture and suffering. I'm sorry, young lady, but I need you to kneel down, put your head in your hands, and close your eyes.",
	"728329": "I'm going to die, aren't I?",
	"728330": "You have to ............ do it as a soldier. Kneel down.",
	"728331": "Ah, the time has finally come. It's not quite what I was expecting, but in any case, it's going to be like this ......, right?",
	"728332": "With that thought, I knelt down. In front of me was a cliff, and the sunlight shone on my face. Then I closed my eyes.",
	"728333": "I heard footsteps behind me. A hunter stood behind me.",
	"728335": "So this is how my journey ends? It began with an order to die, and it will end with an order to die.",
	"728337": "I am sorry. I'm sorry I made you feel scared because I'm lost. I promise you, you won't feel any pain.",
	"728338": "I heard the sound of a safety device being removed.",
	"728339": "It's pitch black, it's pitch black right in front of my eyes. If you close your eyes, it's pitch black everywhere, of course.",
	"728340": "I wonder how ...... mom is doing right now? I wonder if she's still alive?",
	"728341": "I'm so weird. I have no right to miss my mother now.",
	"728342": "Was I this afraid of death?",
	"728343": "Mother ......",
	"728344": "Mother ......",
	"728345": "Don!",
	"728349": "Ugh. ......",
	"728350": "Here is ......",
	"728351": "Smoke is so thick I can't see my surroundings clearly: ......",
	"728352": "Was I ...... asleep?",
	"728353": "At a certain age, I get sleepy as soon as it's lunchtime. This might make me late for my 2 p.m. class.",
	"728354": "My head still doesn't feel clear, but I remember I have things to do. I got up and was about to leave the office.",
	"728355": "Suddenly I saw the blurred shadows of people. They were staring at me from outside the door.",
	"728356": "Who are they? Who am I in the first place?",
	"728357": "Oh, okay. I remembered. They're my friends, my students, and my colleagues. ...... me ......",
	"728358": "They must be stopped. ......",
	"728359": "Sir, we are not here to see the teacher.",
	"728360": "I ...... disagree with your plan.",
	"728361": "Why? You know the teacher. What if we fail?",
	"728362": "But if that victory could not be achieved without sacrificing even one innocent person, how can we say that the project is just?",
	"728363": "...... sir, you haven't changed at all.",
	"728364": "In fact, we have already sacrificed so many innocent people, even though you can't see it. Don't pretend you don't know that.",
	"728365": "I think it would be more hypocritical and despicable of us to get lost for the sake of one child in front of us now and make the blood already spilled meaningless.",
	"728367": "Oh well. We didn't come to school to see the teacher anyway. He has suffered enough. Besides, that man ...... our commander-in-chief understands everything and will lead the corps.",
	"728368": "Wait, ......, just a little--",
	"728369": "I wanted to stop them, hug them, pull their ears and scold them to stop them from going further down the road. I had never been married and had no children. That's why those kids were so ...... important to me.",
	"728370": "Wait ...... me ......",
	"728371": "But I was plunged into a chaotic space as if ink had been applied, and the whole area was blurred, and I could not speak clearly - I was unable to speak clearly.",
	"728372": "Confusion of feelings blocked my senses in a dark, foul, sad swamp: ......",
	"728374": "I heard someone yell \"mother\".",
	"728376": "Don!",
	"728379": "The suffering I had expected did not come. I looked up in surprise to see a pistol kicked up and flying through the air.",
	"728380": "Not yet - it's not over!",
	"728381": "How can you still move! Your limbs are already--oh, I see--",
	"728382": "That armor you wear, utilizing the now obsolete artificial muscle technology of the Aftermath War era. So it's functioning in place of your skeleton--",
	"728383": "The cold iron tightened on the hunter and the two came to a stalemate.",
	"728384": "You squandered the only chance left to surprise me. You are no match for me in close combat. Burn in the fire!",
	"728385": "I knew you would come to that.",
	"728386": "When the hunter reached out to draw his sword, his hand was also gripped by the cold steel and he was unable to move. Strangely enough, he did not try to attack her with his flames from that state.",
	"728387": "Ugh--",
	"728388": "I'm sure the research on the flaming stigmata hadn't realized any major breakthroughs yet. As I thought, it looks like they hadn't yet made it to miniaturization--which would mean that the bulk of the structure of the Stigmata implant is inside that sword!",
	"728389": "So you have to touch the sword to manipulate the ability of the flame stigmata.",
	"728390": "I don't care if you don't have it. Under the circumstances, you can't attack me either, and in a contest of strength like this, the artificial muscles are bound to run out of power in no time. There is no way you can beat a modified Recipient hunter with such a retarded technology that plays on physical strength and endurance.",
	"728391": "Then I guess I'll stop playing the ...... power game--popo!",
	"728392": "Wow, me?",
	"728393": "Do you still remember what we decided with you? Use your light book. Use your head!",
	"728394": "Book of Light ...... understood!",
	"728395": "Picking up the revolver, I shakily loaded it.",
	"728396": "Okay--",
	"728397": "D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d...",
	"728398": "Isn't it just live ammunition? Aren't you afraid of hitting your buddies who are in a scuffle?",
	"728399": "Okay, they don't know.",
	"728400": "I ...... can at least shoot a gun myself!",
	"728401": "Is that gun called a ledger of light? No, no. Is it over there? What is that sound?",
	"728402": "I bet this blow is so amazing that it will make you flake out.",
	"728403": "Such a thing would be a bluff. But this!",
	"728404": "-- [Bwin! -- [boing!",
	"728405": "The hunter looked in the direction of the sound, not at me in front of the cliff, but saw nothing there. At that moment, the cold iron let go of his grasping hand.",
	"728406": "Let's get run over!",
	"728407": "Don!",
	"728408": "At the moment of impact, a huge advanced infantry fighting vehicle revealed itself, which had been hidden by the light. Yes, the porcupine, rushing in at full power, slammed into the hunter - and the porcupine was in the process of being hit by the hunter.",
	"728409": "And both fell headlong down the cliff!",
	"728414": "I won ....... ......",
	"728415": "Slam!",
	"728416": "The cold iron fell to the ground.",
	"728417": "Cold iron, are you okay?",
	"728418": "I'm not going to die ....... Tie me to the bike. His people will be here soon, so we have to go ...... fast.",
	"728419": "Oh, ......, yes.",
	"728420": "Yes, sorry.",
	"728422": "I can't do what I said I would do to you. Can you patch me through to the Stigmata Bureau for a minute: ......",
	"728423": "I stopped selling you.",
	"728424": "Night of the 13th day of the trip.",
	"728425": "Ouch, be a little more gentle with me: ......",
	"728426": "Yes, yes, yes.",
	"728427": "He was able to move with artificial muscles and beat the hunters, but he still had a broken bone.",
	"728428": "No matter how much his body has undergone modifications, an injury of this magnitude would take a lot of time to recover from.",
	"728429": "We're going to be down a lot of fighting power for some time to come.",
	"728430": "I still think the elite of the regular army of the Legion is very strong. Even a single hunter is that terrifying, and the hunters must be working in groups of five or more when eliminating the Stigmata. ......",
	"728431": "I had no idea that there are at least tens of thousands of hunters like that in the Southern Legion.",
	"728432": "That was because I wasn't equipped with a stigmatic implant! I know there are probably a lot of hunting captains in the southern army, but that guy I just saw is probably the strongest of them all. That's why I think he's on a mission to test ...... hah ...... prototype version of the Stigmata grafts.",
	"728433": "If only I had my specialty, the grafted body of a holy scar, I could take out a guy like that in an instant... ouch!",
	"728434": "Transplants you are good at? Oh, I heard that ...... the sacraments that a sacramentalist can awaken and use are the ones they are born with, but the recipient is not.",
	"728435": "Yeah ...... Well, here's the thing. In the case of the Southern Army, for example, the candidates for the recipient are selected from among those soldiers with significant war results.",
	"728436": "Generally, the recipient receives an examination report from the military medical center ...... or in the case of the Southern Army, the Southern Stigmata Bureau, prior to undergoing remodeling surgery and substrate attachment surgery.",
	"728437": "The test report includes a number of characteristics of the sacrament that match the subject's genetic information. It also indicates the degree of adaptability of each.",
	"728438": "Usually, if the adaptability is above 60%, the sacrament can be implanted, and if it reaches 80% or more, it can be expected to be quite a good fighter. In the case of the sacraments that the hunters equip themselves with, the adaptability is generally 95%.",
	"728439": "Heh ...... So what if, for example, all the apt sacraments are useless, or the apt sacraments are not yet researched?",
	"728440": "That doesn't make me a hunter. But the body that has been enhanced by remodeling surgery can be used properly. In the southern army, such people are generally in charge of mobile knights.",
	"728441": "These people can withstand strong G's, which is why they'll be knights of the airborne machines with mobile armor. Mobile knights may not be able to win against sacristans and hunters, but they are good at operations against battleships and regular land forces.",
	"728442": "Fuun...... so what type of stigmata do you specialize in?",
	"728443": "Want to know?",
	"728444": "If you don't want to say it, that's fine.",
	"728445": "Then I'll tell you. It goes by my name too!",
	"728446": "I specialize in, as the name implies, \"cold\" and \"iron.\" In other words, an implant of ice and snow and metal stigmata. I have a 99.7% adaptability for ice and snow and 93.2% for metal.",
	"728447": "So you're saying that when in perfect condition, they're equipped with ice and snow and metal implants at the same time?",
	"728448": "No, you can only have one. It is theoretically possible to equip two at the same time, but doing so would cause the entire body to collapse within a short period of time. All the experiments that have been done so far have shown such results without exception. ......",
	"728449": "Yes, yes, I understand.",
	"728450": "He poured some water into the mouth of the cold iron.",
	"728451": "Then ...... last question.",
	"728452": "Cold Iron ...... you weren't a ...... stigmata hunter in the beginning, were you?",
	"728453": "...... Yes.",
	"728454": "What kind of person are you in the first place?",
	"728456": "......How should I put it: ......",
	"728457": "Okay, here's what I'm going to do. Tell me what you know about the World Builders Corps.",
	"728458": "Ee: ......",
	"728459": "I did my best to recall what was written in my middle school textbooks and described the approximate content.",
	"728460": "In 2018, the Federation of Human Contractors began to polarize into New York and Geneva. The power was not held by the members of the Board of Directors, but by the \"Heroes of Disintegration\" who controlled the battleship Moonlight Throne.",
	"728461": "The following year, in 2019, a vacancy occurred. Half of the board members were absent from a meeting at the Federation of People's Contractors in New York, symbolizing a formal split.",
	"728462": "Then in 2022, a world war called the Aftermath War broke out between the two sides, and the war ended in 2027, or the 10th year of the Legion.",
	"728463": "It was not either of the divided sides that ended the war, but the soldiers on the front lines who could not stand idly by as the world continued to degenerate.",
	"728464": "Those soldiers organized the First Legion, which eventually overthrew the Human Qi Federation's form of governance.",
	"728465": "The First Legion then joined forces with other responding legions to establish the World Building Corps. With its strong power, ideals, and disintegrating energy, it set the world right and became the first truly global regime in human history.",
	"728466": "That's what my textbook says at .......",
	"728467": "Yeah yeah yeah, it makes me kind of happy to hear ...... people say it like that.",
	"728468": "Glad ......? So what does the World Corps have to do with the issue of who you are?",
	"728469": "It's very relevant.",
	"728471": "Because I am the founder.",
	"728472": "Huh?",
	"728473": "Ita Tata! One of the - I'm one of the founders!",
	"728474": "-- [buin ......\"",
	"728477": "At the bottom of the cliff a man was standing on top of an infantry fighting vehicle. The man pulled out a camera attached to the outside of the vehicle and the cord was exposed. The machine shuddered as if it had been yanked out of its spinal cord. Flames were visible through the gaps in the vehicle, as if it was on fire inside.",
	"728478": "Disposal completed.",
	"728479": "The man then randomly sat on top of a scrapped vehicle. After a while, he heard the sound of an engine from above, and a young man in a hunter's outfit peeked out from the top of the cliff.",
	"728480": "Whoa, my dad didn't die, did he?",
	"728481": "The opponent was quite formidable. She was not equipped with an implant and could not use disintegration energy, but I should not have let my guard down. It was my fault.",
	"728482": "Who in the world is so strong that he can't even beat my dad? Who's that strong?",
	"728483": "The upper echelons of the First Corps: ......",
	"728484": "The upper echelons of the First Corps are all dismantled by our military: ......",
	"728485": "Hound07, shut up. Email me what you have to say.",
	"728486": "Uh-huh!",
	"728487": "Not an active member, but an already retired upper echelon of the corps. ...... Strictly speaking, an already retired upper echelon of the world-building corps. It's the legendary generation that broke up the rule by the Human Qi Federation.",
	"728488": "So she didn't have a ...... transplant because she already had a ......",
	"728489": "Because I already retired?",
	"728490": "Yes, I did. When I was decommissioned, I submitted the two transplants I had.",
	"728491": "At that time, with all of the human Qiren cleared out, all of the traitors and opportunists in the corps eliminated, and the secret of the collapsing energy revealed, I thought it was time to put down the guns and enjoy the prosperity and peace. ......",
	"728492": "......In hindsight, in the end, I was just as naive in my thinking as those people.",
	"728493": "Who are those people?",
	"728494": "It's about the heroes who ended the previous era, who thought they had defeated the overseer of wills, triumphed over collapse, and put an end to everything.",
	"728495": "Was it my imagination? Cold Iron was wearing a mask, but it seemed to me that she was disappointed.",
	"728496": "Well, now that I've explained it to you, you know that you've actually heard about me before, don't you? You've read about it in your textbooks, the cold iron.",
	"728497": "Ummm ............",
	"728498": "What do you think? What do young people your age think of me?",
	"728499": "Not at all. ......",
	"728500": "I have no idea. Who is Cold Steel? Is he a famous singer or something?",
	"728501": "Even the most studious hound, Hound 04, doesn't know. 06 and 07, 08 and 09 also say they don't know.",
	"728502": "What do you think, Dad? I was right, wasn't I? He's not that famous. And he may have been a great guy back then, but isn't he just an old lady now?",
	"728503": "At the bottom of the cliff, almost all the hunters in the hound platoon had gathered.",
	"728504": "No thanks. She's still only a little past her prime because she's been genetically modified and should not be underestimated: ......",
	"728505": "...... No, and you guys are telling the truth? You're not lying, are you? Never heard of cold iron? [寒鉄]<color=#DC143CFF>above the cold sound</color>.",
	"728506": "The man asked again, incredulous.",
	"728507": "I really don't know.",
	"728508": "I just checked the intranet database and it's interesting. The leaders of the uprising during the Aftermath War, most of them called each other by code names.",
	"728509": "I've been looking into it, and it seems that the person was indeed involved in many operations and battles, but not as a central figure in any of them, but as a close observer. But he wasn't a key player in any of them. He was more like a bystander. ...... He was called by some as a \"legendary supporting actor.",
	"728510": "Totally ...... anyway, she's not a one trick pony. Hound10, tell them all.",
	"728512": "Dad, you forgot. Hound 10 was killed in a sweep last month.",
	"728515": "Oh ...... sorry. I'm still getting used to it.",
	"728516": "Anyway, ...... \"Cold Iron\" or <color=#DC143CFF>Mo Chan Oto</color> is very famous. After she retired, she became the head teacher at the top tactical school of the I Corps. Many of the division commanders were trained by her.",
	"728517": "I know that one! It's a school built on a floating island!",
	"728518": "What do you know, more than a decade ago, I went to that school as an exchange student. At the time, she taught mainly the history and application of <color=#DC143CFF>Sentojo no Senjutsu</color>, and at the end of the semester, she had us do a pair of exercises where we had to play one-on-one.",
	"728519": "One is the \"Tenkari\" unit of the Jinki-ren, and the other is the War Maiden.",
	"728520": "What is the Tenkari Unit?",
	"728521": "It's kind of like being a hunter, isn't it?",
	"728522": "Yeah, well, it's similar. The target of the extermination is mainly the remnants of the old heavenly life, though.",
	"728523": "Back then I was ...... having a bit of a rough time. Because of my family situation, I didn't have a good relationship and I couldn't find classmates to ...... pair up with.",
	"728524": "I was finally able to do my final exercise assignment, too, with my teacher, Kangetsu, paired with me.",
	"728525": "Which side did Dad do?",
	"728526": "I'm on the ...... side of the War Maiden. It was three days of desperately holding on.",
	"728527": "She herself has probably forgotten, but I had fought against her at that time. That Type 07 was also the weapon she used to fight the Jinki-ren during the war. I have seen it in a museum, so I am sure of it.",
	"728528": "Indeed, some people refer to her as a \"legendary supporting player\". But we should keep in mind that even a legendary supporting player is part of the legend. And it is hard to believe that she is going to stay quiet. As long as she is alive, she will try to contact the remnants of the military to rebuild.",
	"728529": "If she should be able to rebuild the First Corps, there is no telling when she will be able to end the war. Besides, she's the type of ......",
	"728530": "Anyway, we must go after her as fast as we can right away. As someone who once learned from her, it is the greatest respect to do so. Hound 03, tell everyone to get ready immediately. And call hound 02--",
	"728531": "Get ready now. I will immediately apply to leave the jurisdiction Site-16. We're going to surround and destroy it.",
	"728533": "They're going to surround us!",
	"728534": "Yeah ...... I'm sure they know who I am by now and will surround me soon.",
	"728535": "If you ask me, ...... surely you're right. And there shouldn't be much more time ...... before we are surrounded.",
	"728536": "Well, don't panic so much. The southern army is a forest of factions, and the way things are done is old-fashioned. It takes time to move soldiers, except when the General, whom everyone loves, is in charge.",
	"728537": "I have to get the stigmata grafts somehow before I get surrounded and attacked. Hopefully I can get the ice stigmata, which is what I am best at.",
	"728538": "Yes, I know. Stigmata ...... but in this body now ......",
	"728539": "Sure the condition sucks but ...... I have an idea.",
	"728541": "Morning of the 15th day of the trip.",
	"728542": "Ta-ta, ta-ta, ta-ta: ......",
	"728543": "The heels of his shoes touched the ground, and the sound echoed through the square.",
	"728544": "Cold Steel, you said. He said the trading floor is so complex in structure that it's like a labyrinth of alloy structures, also known as a \"steel nest.\"",
	"728545": "The steel den was cold and eerily shaped. Looking around, all that could be seen was rusted and twisted metal. What appeared to have been originally attached to the wall was broken and peeling, with holes here and there.",
	"728546": "And the wind was blowing through the open hole, playing a low, sad, sobbing sound.",
	"728548": "Sunlight was scattered by a steel dome riddled with rust and holes, some of which illuminated the shoulders of the cold steel. As we moved deeper into the steel nest, the sunlight gradually diminished and artificial lighting illuminated the area.",
	"728549": "In the center of the steel nest, an obviously overworked researcher was crouched down, and behind him a figure with a gun lined up side by side, waiting for the cold steel to come.",
	"728550": "Then both sides stood facing each other.",
	"728551": "Stigmata station, right?",
	"728552": "This is the Southern Stigmata Bureau's site lab. Don't ask me which group.",
	"728553": "Well, okay. I brought him.",
	"728554": "Let them do it.",
	"728555": "Is that really necessary?",
	"728556": "Newcomers can't be trusted. Last week, a fusion lab research team bought a guinea pig with a big check. I was told they were the owners of the fusion sacrament, but they were just phonies.",
	"728557": "Well, it was the end of the quarter and we had a lot of unspent expenses, so we hired mercenaries to take care of that fraudulent hunter.",
	"728558": "(gulped and spit ......)",
	"728559": "Heh, interesting story.",
	"728560": "Come on, let me see.",
	"728561": "I can't help it. Come on, Popo. Show them what you've done.",
	"728562": "Oh ...... yeah ......",
	"728563": "You don't want to get spanked again, do you?",
	"728564": "Yes I will do ...... because I don't want to get hit by ......!",
	"728566": "How's that? I told you. This guy has the ability to manipulate lasers.",
	"728567": "Yeah ...... sure swung the meter too. Okay, we have a deal.",
	"728568": "What did I ask for?",
	"728569": "An employee of the Bureau of Stigmata lifted a suitcase in her hand. As she lifted the suitcase, thin ice crystals spread from the handles and instantly covered the entire case.",
	"728570": "After unlocking and opening the box, the employee removed the small chip from his own hand and placed it in the box.",
	"728571": "A genuine Ice Stigmata graft. The Southern Stigmata Office is very strict in their dealings and research.",
	"728572": "That's the best. Look, when the kid is halfway through, throw the case over here.",
	"728573": "I understand.",
	"728574": "All right. Popo, go.",
	"728575": "Okay. ......",
	"728576": "He stepped out and began to move forward.",
	"728577": "I shivered and staggered through the steel nest floor with cords exposed here and there.",
	"728578": "One-fifth, one-quarter, one-third......",
	"728579": "One-half.",
	"728580": "I looked up and saw the people at the Stigmata station. Soldiers were pointing their guns in my direction.",
	"728581": "Stop. Stop moving forward. Or I will shoot you.",
	"728582": "I turned around and saw Kantetsu holding a gun.",
	"728583": "Give me the product.",
	"728584": "Hm, take it.",
	"728585": "The case flew toward Cold Iron. Cold Iron did not reach out or change his posture, but stopped it with his foot after the case fell to the floor.",
	"728586": "He continued to hold the gun for a while, but then switched the gun from both hands to one hand, put his weight on the edge of the case, raised the case and held it with his free hand.",
	"728587": "You got your deal, goodbye. I don't think we'll be seeing each other again.",
	"728588": "I'm so busy that I don't have time to see you. I haven't finished the report yet. Let's go.",
	"728589": "As we said this to each other, the cold steel gradually backed away and the Stigmata Bureau staff walked ...... toward me and approached.",
	"728590": "Don!",
	"728591": "Ugh!",
	"728592": "What's going on?",
	"728593": "Ah!",
	"728594": "Sir, be careful. There's a sniper up there--",
	"728595": "The eyes of the soldiers gathered in the direction of the gunfire. And then--",
	"728596": "Don!",
	"728597": "Gho--gho--gho--gho ......",
	"728598": "Wow, my report! Don't die. Don't die--",
	"728599": "When they saw me fall down, the Stigmata Bureau staff rushed toward me like crazy.",
	"728600": "Funny ...... in this direction--there are no snipers. It's an auto-set weapon and blanks - get back, doctor, get back!",
	"728601": "Have I been found out? But don't worry, you found out too late. The Stigmata Bureau officials are already right in front of me.",
	"728602": "What?",
	"728603": "Don!",
	"728604": "Captured.",
	"728605": "When he pulled the trigger, the revolver's magazine rotated, and a bullet of disintegrating energy that had been filled instantly pierced the officer's chest.",
	"728607": "Two nights ago.",
	"728608": "The Recipient's attention is distracted by a third party who thinks he is being attacked by a third party with blanks, etc., and the Recipient is taken down at an opening. ...... Sounds like a trick battle between trading mafias, doesn't it?",
	"728609": "Well, that's about it. I'm a lot weaker now than I was when I first met you, so I need your help. First, I need to neutralize the other recipient.",
	"728610": "Also, we need to change who we are dealing with. The Stigmata warlords in the southern army move their troops very fast, and I will not be able to beat their mobile knights in my current state, so I will make a deal with the Stigmata Bureau, which is easier to deal with.",
	"728611": "So you would cancel the deal with the Stigmatic Military Nobility then?",
	"728612": "No, I know those guys from when I used to be a school vice principal. They are usually arrogant, and they recently won a major war. If we suddenly canceled the deal, I'm sure they would immediately follow the signal and yell at us.",
	"728613": "So we don't cancel the deal, we stand down. By the time they realize they've been stood up, we'll already have the sacrament and be hiding out where they can't find us.",
	"728614": "Once I have the stigmatic implant, I will regain full operational capability, and then I can gather the scattered legionnaires and rebuild my army.",
	"728615": "It means that as long as we can win this one, we have a ...... chance.",
	"728617": "Haa............",
	"728618": "Finally I ...... got it all figured out.",
	"728619": "Why didn't I have something more important than life, such as an implant of a sacrament? Why did you do such a terrible thing as a sacrament hunter? Why are you so kind? Why do you not want to stop? Why are you willing to risk so much to fight? ......",
	"728620": "But, you know, I ...... am good.",
	"728621": "Hm?",
	"728622": "If I have to cross a very dangerous bridge, ...... I can be sold to the Stigmata Bureau.",
	"728623": "You may not know it, but I ...... am actually not a nice kid who would give his life for his mother.",
	"728624": "For quite some time, Mom could no longer bear the pain of the erosion of the disintegration. But I didn't know what to do with myself once she was gone, so I couldn't make up my mind to release her from her suffering and help her become a Buddha.",
	"728625": "I've been tormenting my mother, who gave birth to me, like that all my life.",
	"728626": "I don't know where I am safe in this world, I don't know who I can trust, and I don't know where to go or what to do once my current position as a \"commodity\" is gone ...... I have nothing I need to do.",
	"728627": "But you are not. I can tell. I know that you are a good person, a very great person, and that you are just going through a bit of a setback right now.",
	"728628": "So you might as well use me to get the real deal and win without risking ...... no?",
	"728629": "......Yes, that's right. It is better to save many people by sacrificing one than to put on a facade of righteousness that no one should be sacrificed.",
	"728630": "And I'm in a position where I have to make decisions now.",
	"728631": "I have certainly thought about it, as you say. I admit it. And I know it's more rational to do as you say.",
	"728632": "But I figured it out. I'm not a rational person by nature, and I can't ignore the voice inside me. I always end up giving in to my impulsive feelings and attracting trouble myself.",
	"728633": "It wasn't after much deliberation that I joined the corps and took a stand against the Jinki-ren.",
	"728634": "That's right. ......",
	"728635": "I used to be a very insignificant person. But one day, a very dear friend of mine was killed by the Jinki-ren, and that made me so mad that I decided to resist the Jinki-ren to the very end.",
	"728636": "After that, I went from being an unknown soldier to a high-ranking military officer, and I, the number of people I knew and cared about grew and grew, and I had to worry about a lot of things no matter what I did. ......",
	"728637": "But I am still the same old me.",
	"728638": "Well, you can think of it as my former teaching relationship. I will not sell you, and I will not lose you. And I will always win in the end.",
	"728639": "When the time comes, I will personally instruct you on philosophical matters such as the meaning of life and where to turn.",
	"728640": "Anyway, let's trick them now and make the operation a clean success!",
	"728642": "The way I told you is much easier: ......",
	"728644": "Presently.",
	"728645": "Ugh ---- why do you need a gun!",
	"728646": "Yay ......'s?",
	"728647": "Nice, Popo. Now get down. I'll take care of the rest--",
	"728648": "As soon as Kantetsu said that, bullets rained down on her like a hail of bullets. But that didn't mean anything.",
	"728649": "What the hell? What the hell is going on? How can a bullet slip through without hitting me?",
	"728650": "You guys ...... gobble gobble ...... use your heads a little bit. Those two are in on it ...... they're bending the ...... light with the power of the Stigmata of Light. ......",
	"728651": "So does that mean that the actual location of that woman is ...... and we were hitting at a phantom!",
	"728652": "What are you talking about now? Get back quickly--cover yourself in a tight spot and attack--you'll be in trouble.",
	"728653": "Are you trying to escape?",
	"728654": "It was probably because the other recipient was still alive. Despite his injuries, Cold Steel immediately raised his gun and gave chase.",
	"728655": "Popo, let's go.",
	"728656": "Cold Steel instructed me to grab my suitcase and shouted loudly as if to vent my feelings deep into the labyrinth of steel nests.",
	"728657": "How does it feel to be cheated?",
	"728658": "Don!",
	"728659": "Ten, nine, eight--",
	"728660": "Since he had already prepared countermeasures against various types of opponents before the transaction, and had already grasped the actual number of opponents and their positions on the spot, Kantetsu advanced through the steel nest with steady steps and disposed of one enemy after another in a very rhythmical manner.",
	"728661": "It must be a sign of his composure that he mumbles about the number of remaining enemies, as if talking to himself.",
	"728662": "I can't see ...... the other guy at all! Oh--!",
	"728663": "Another shot at the phantom I had created, and then a gun barrel extending from nowhere was plunged into his mouth and shot, leaving a horrible blood trail.",
	"728664": "7.",
	"728665": "Don!",
	"728666": "6.",
	"728667": "I could hear the sound of sweeping shots from the far end of the aisle, followed shortly thereafter by the sound of a decimation. The battle seemed almost over. The enemy's will to fight had now collapsed, and the only thing left to do was clean up the mess.",
	"728668": "Four, three, two--",
	"728669": "Aaahhh!",
	"728670": "Bye-bye.",
	"728671": "The researcher from the Stigmata Bureau made a deadly lunge, but it made no sense at all. She lunged toward the cold iron phantom, but behind the phantom, a single sharp rebar of steel web jutted out.",
	"728672": "Zero.",
	"728673": "Cold Steel lowered his gun and looked back in the direction he had gone and made a piece.",
	"728674": "We won!",
	"728675": "I'm on the right side of you.",
	"728676": "Oops. Well, it's all taken care of anyway.",
	"728677": "Let's check just to be sure: ...... Surely they're all dead, thank goodness. Then we can sort out the supplies.",
	"728678": "We've seen battles before, but battles are the ones that take people's hearts and souls in the first place. I almost panicked and couldn't remember any of the conventional plans.",
	"728679": "Listen to me. At any time, at any moment, you must be on your guard, thinking that the enemy may still have a trick left up his sleeve. That's a lifetime of valuable experience for a grandmother who is about to turn 60.\"",
	"728680": "A solid-level opponent will try to set you up when you're at your most careless.\"",
	"728681": "(Surely ...... then the next step is to lure out the enemy.)",
	"728682": "Cold Steel walked slowly through a nest of steel. She was on her guard, her hand close to the short-tube shotgun at her hip.",
	"728683": "(Okay, now that we've eliminated the effects of hiding, we look exactly as defenseless as we are. ...... Come on out to the bait and take the bait.)",
	"728684": "The response I was expecting was not .......",
	"728685": "Oh, yeah. Popo, give me that transplant.",
	"728686": "Did the approach we took earlier not work? Or are we just comparing wits with an enemy that doesn't exist in the first place? But we got a sign from the cold steel, which means we're in the second half of the lure-out operation.",
	"728687": "Yeah.",
	"728688": "I released the case. I had made an illusion of her and myself beforehand to cover our position in the real one.",
	"728689": "Therefore, the illusion of the case that was being made at the same time was received by the illusion of the cold iron, and the real cold iron received the real case.",
	"728690": "Ok. It's the long awaited ice stigmata. Bring back my true strength--hahaha!",
	"728691": "(It's so deliberate it's embarrassing to watch. ...... I'm glad she's wearing a mask.)",
	"728692": "If she is going to come out, it is now or never. Because if we don't stop the cold steel here and she wears the ice stigmata, it will be 1000 times harder to ...... stop her from going.",
	"728693": "(Come on out ......)",
	"728694": "Gui-------- --i------ ------",
	"728695": "The door suddenly opened.",
	"728696": "Don!",
	"728697": "I got you -- I got you!",
	"728698": "Before I could react, the cold iron attacked.",
	"728700": "2 days ago. Night of the 13th day of the trip.",
	"728701": "No good.",
	"728703": "Please wait ...... I am talking about cold iron. <color=#DC143CFF>Mo Kan'on</color>, aka Cold Iron. He is a legendary hero.",
	"728704": "Isn't it a legendary supporting role?",
	"728705": "Captain Qin, you have not forgotten that it is your responsibility to keep the Site-16 safe. What you should do is not to go out aggressively.",
	"728706": "We have done away with many division commanders of the 1st Corps. There is no way that a former teacher who has already retired can make a big splash.",
	"728707": "You, I assume you're within radio range. The war is almost over, but the situation in the territory is far from stable.",
	"728708": "But--",
	"728709": "There are units of the 1st Division in Hermann's vicinity that have yet to be destroyed, and according to the story, they have selected a leader and are bringing him up. Although some of the information is not certain, the leader is said to call himself \"the indomitable one.",
	"728710": "Near Site-12, we hear that a madman named Lee Jessica is proselytizing his belief in disintegration, and in the eastern towns, local armed forces, calling themselves dragons, have taken over.",
	"728711": "I heard that the Eastern Legion recently eradicated a fool who was running a second-hand toy store. The person was said to have gathered a dozen or so people on the Internet, and was pretending to create a human empire and rebuild the world.",
	"728712": "In our territory alone, there are more than 200 armed groups of various sizes that we have to clear out.",
	"728713": "Under these circumstances, even if Kiana Kasrana were to show up, you would not be allowed to leave this site, much less an old person who doesn't even have a stigmatic implant.",
	"728714": "What's the use of saying a name that sounds like something out of a fairy tale at a time like this? No, for once we can't back down here. ......",
	"728715": "The Knights of Mobile are very good at dealing with such things. Our mission as hunters is to eliminate the powerful. ......",
	"728716": "The mission of the hunter is to obey orders.",
	"728717": "Why?",
	"728718": "Why has my boss's attitude done a complete 180 in the last few hours?",
	"728719": "Does he not understand? That man ...... has the energy and willpower that people of that era have, plus the philosophy of the First Corps ......",
	"728720": "That the longer they exist in the world, even for one second, the greater the threat to our legions will become?",
	"728721": "Anyway, this is the decision. Captain Qin, you are a competent man, but you are too stubborn. You should know what is important and what is not.",
	"728722": "If you had behaved according to your part on a regular basis, you would have been promoted to the rank of major by now.",
	"728723": "Yes ......",
	"728724": "Well, you get the idea. Well, that's what I'm going to do. ......",
	"728725": "Is it because ...... pursuit would be entering the territory of Mr. Lancaster, knighthood?",
	"728726": "Ki...... what are you talking about? Whose territory is it? All southern troops are following the orders of the corps central department - you'll be court-martialed if you say that. Take back what you just said anyway. Hari-tora, are you listening to me?",
	"728727": "But the cold iron is really--",
	"728728": "That's enough, Captain!",
	"728730": "The order has already been given, so follow the order anyway.",
	"728731": "We have already tolerated you. I've turned a blind eye to the fact that you've turned the hunting party into an orphanage. You need to learn a little bit of respect.",
	"728732": "Then tell me again what we should do from now on.",
	"728733": ".............................. Defend Site-16 and give up the cold-iron chase.",
	"728734": "Mm, that's fine.",
	"728735": "Bi---",
	"728737": "The series of reasons that Major General Karos gave ...... none of them were very convincing. Even if he wasn't a ...... big-picture oriented person, why was he so adamant about not listening?",
	"728738": "Cold iron is not important? No, it can't be. Then why try to deal with it at all? And what's to stop them from going after it?",
	"728739": "Dad, what's wrong?",
	"728740": "In the distance, hound 03 waved his hand.",
	"728741": "The children are smart, but I still prefer not to talk too much about these topics.",
	"728742": "We're back.",
	"728743": "I walked over to them.",
	"728744": "I suddenly stopped.",
	"728745": "He then formed a pistol shape with his hand and pointed his fingertips at the heads of the boy hunters standing in the distance.",
	"728747": "(No. ...... imagination alone is not acceptable.)",
	"728748": "...... today......I put a gun to that kid's head......",
	"728749": "To that girl who looked like burnt ashes. That girl was about the same age as the children of the hound platoon.",
	"728750": "I don't want to hurt these kids, but to try to pull the trigger on that girl who turned to me with the best of intentions. ...... Am I that kind of person?",
	"728751": "When are you leaving?",
	"728752": "We are ......",
	"728754": "If he continued to think, he was going to have thoughts that he should not have as a soldier. So he stopped thinking once and for all to remain loyal as he had always been. Then he said the following.",
	"728755": "Cancel the plan.",
	"728756": "---------- ---- as of now.",
	"728757": "Don!",
	"728758": "Bullets penetrated the metal door and the cold steel kicked down the door and took aim.",
	"728762": "But there was no one there.",
	"728763": "........................ Phew... ...This means we definitely don't have any more enemies, right? Cold iron......?",
	"728764": "Yes, we've already played the \"off guard moment. We've already played the \"off guard moment\" and ...... this is the end result - it's like we were playing wits with an enemy that never existed in the first place and there was no enemy hiding in plain sight.",
	"728765": "I'm glad ...... that people didn't see that awful performance earlier.",
	"728766": "Even if he did see us, he wouldn't be alive anyway. We'll take care of it.",
	"728767": "Well then, let's take a break: ........................... ...",
	"728768": "We waited.",
	"728769": "It's at this moment, right now, that we are the most careless!",
	"728771": "The moment Cold Steel said that, I felt the atmosphere around me change. It was as if something invisible was approaching and springing ...... out of me. ...... This is ...... quickly! Quickly--we must hurry----!",
	"728772": "Hurry up and put it on, the stigmata!",
	"728773": "Hurry up and put it on--whoosh!",
	"728774": "Cold Iron thought the same thing as I did at the same time and tried to open the case containing the ice stigmata.",
	"728775": "But the case did not open.",
	"728776": "More strictly speaking, I should say that the case refused to be opened by the cold steel. The handle of the case became entangled in her fingers.",
	"728777": "Metal wraps around!",
	"728778": "What, this!",
	"728779": "Dong-dong-dong!",
	"728780": "The cold iron attempted to manage the metal wrapping around his hands with a gun, but it had little effect.",
	"728781": "Popo--",
	"728782": "Run away now!",
	"728783": "But--",
	"728784": "This is the power of the metal stigmata, get out of here. ------",
	"728785": "Seeing me in a daze, the cold steel dropped his gun without hesitation and released a grenade between us.",
	"728786": "Ugh--",
	"728787": "Driven by a survival instinct, I ran away from there at once.",
	"728788": "Hiding yourself, creating the illusion of an obstacle, making this wall transparent, that one transparent--",
	"728789": "With my train of thought completely shut down, I ran for cover. As the sound of gunfire from behind me gradually diminished, I thought I heard someone speaking.",
	"728790": "But I could not understand its content. Because I was completely focused on something else.",
	"728791": "Yes, to escape--",
	"728792": "We have to run!",
	"728793": "Haa...... haa...... haa...... haa...... haa......",
	"728794": "After fleeing so exhausted and exhausted that I couldn't move another step, I leaned against the wall ...... and slowly sat down.",
	"728795": "Finally, I was able to move my body at will.",
	"728796": "I gathered my strength and looked back to chew on each frame that had just happened.",
	"728797": "There is an ambush: ......",
	"728798": "The guy was manipulating metal stigmata. ......",
	"728799": "Cold Steel has been caught: ......",
	"728800": "And ...... that guy at the end, at the end, he said this: ......",
	"728801": "How do you feel? How does it feel to be tricked and tricked some more ......[cold iron] aka <color=#DC143CFF>Mo Chan Oto</color>......\"",
	"728803": "No, it's not.",
	"728804": "That wasn't the last time.",
	"728805": "That man further said.",
	"728806": "So ............",
	"728807": "Or maybe I should say ...... like this. <color=#DC143CFF>Itsumatsu Tetsushi</color>, a.k.a. [Cold Iron].\"",
	"728808": "Pitt.................. Pitt......... ............Pick............... .........Pick.................. ......",
	"728809": "Pitt ............ Pitt ............ Pitt... ......... bleep............",
	"728810": "bleep............ bleep...... bleep......... ...bleep......",
	"728811": "bleep...... bleep......... bleep.........",
	"728813": "That's very shaky. ...... I wonder if the plane ran into some turbulence?",
	"728814": "I wonder if there will be any delays in my arrival? I hope it won't give a bad image from the first day of my arrival?",
	"728815": "Well, I don't care if it makes a bad impression. I don't like that kind of thing. ......",
	"728816": "I'll quit ...... someday anyway.",
	"728817": "Quit ...... quit ...... funny isn't it?",
	"728818": "I've already-- I've already formed a human-rights coalition.",
	"728819": "I quit already. ...... should be, right?",
	"728820": "Beep, beep, beep ......",
	"728821": "It's dazzling......Where am I? I opened my eyes and what I saw was the ceiling. ......The ceiling feels so close. ......",
	"728822": "Is there anyone ...... who can help me ...... why am I ...... lying in bed?",
	"728823": "I don't know why. When I opened my mouth, it was extremely difficult to move my vocal cords and tongue as if they were rusty gears or something. My lungs were like old bellows, and it took a lot of strength to move them.",
	"728824": "The voice that came out of his mouth was so weak and feeble that it seemed to reach only to his own ears.",
	"728825": "I'm ...... anyone ...... anyone?",
	"728826": "I'm so tired......I can't believe how tired I am just talking......I think I'll take some more rest......",
	"728828": "Is there anyone - is there anyone - is there anyone!",
	"728829": "Yes, I shouldn't. Houraiji reminded me of ...... me. I had something I had to do. That plan--Houraidera-san......Houraidera-san is in danger!",
	"728830": "A little bit of strength came out of nowhere. Struggling, I managed to lift my head 15 or 20 degrees ...... and the bed was placed in what was probably a very large vehicle, still moving on the road. There was a door nearby.",
	"728831": "Kacha!",
	"728832": "At that moment, the nurse and someone else opened the door laughing and walked in. Then their eyes met mine.",
	"728833": "At that moment, she dropped what she was holding on the floor.",
	"728834": "Hi ...... where am I--please don't go for a minute!",
	"728835": "Upon seeing me awake, the nurse quickly walked out the door I had entered.",
	"728836": "I - I'd like you to take the one that is fixed.",
	"728837": "I struggled on the bed. It was like a caterpillar being poked by a person with the tip of a branch.",
	"728838": "What's up, what's up ...... You really woke up!",
	"728839": "Someone came in again. Is this person a soldier of the Jinki-ren? Have I been captured?",
	"728840": "Ugh-- hey--",
	"728841": "Just as I was about to speak, the soldier held me by the collarbone and I had no choice but to lie down on the bed. The soldier took out a small flashlight with his other hand to illuminate my eyes, and I couldn't help but be dazzled.",
	"728842": "Answer me. Who are you?",
	"728843": "Yes? You guys keep catching me on ...... how come you don't know who I am?",
	"728844": "Why am I so tired? Do I feel so short of breath after just two words?",
	"728845": "Answer honestly. Who are you?",
	"728846": "I ...... am a former employee of the Federation of People's Contractors, and I'm an Iron Master ...... I'm Iron Master Issatsu.",
	"728847": "You are the Iron Master Issatsu of this era, aren't you?",
	"728848": "What do you mean?",
	"728849": "Oh?",
	"728850": "Put the equipment away. It makes no sense to her.",
	"728851": "Someone seems to have entered through a door out of sight. I remember hearing this voice ...... somewhere ......?",
	"728852": "She has no sacrament. She is trustworthy.",
	"728854": "You, release Mr. Iron Master.",
	"728855": "Ha!",
	"728856": "Uu......",
	"728857": "The soldier stopped holding me down and I felt much better in the chest area. I'm kind of really tired, but ...... now is not the time to slow down. There are things that need to be done--",
	"728858": "Director Shikatsuji ...... please contact Ms. Houraiji ...... her as soon as possible. There is a conspiracy going on inside the Jinki-ren, and she, and those she cares about, are being targeted--and I'm not sure what to do about it.",
	"728859": "Please. Please contact Mr. Houraiji now.",
	"728862": "The moderator director did not respond to any ...... I don't think ...... he is also a member of the ...... conspiracy?",
	"728863": "Telling them while their bodies are still recovering may take time for them to accept it as reality, though.",
	"728864": "What?",
	"728865": "But I'm sure it's better to tell them early than to hold out hope all the time and be devastated at the end - it's not going to happen in time anymore.",
	"728866": "What do you mean? Have they ......Houraiji Kyuushou been ...... attacked already?",
	"728867": "That's not all I have to tell you. From the time you were shot that day to the time you wake up today, you've already ......",
	"728868": "It's been three years, you know.",
	"728870": "3 years ......3 years! 3 years?",
	"728871": "I'm so stupid ......",
	"728872": "I knew I couldn't help her. ......",
	"728873": "What happened to your father and mother?",
	"728874": "Unspeakable noise flowed into my head like dammed water.",
	"728875": "And finally I felt that the world had gone dark.",
	"728878": "Kacha.",
	"728879": "Ugh. ......",
	"728880": "I really don't like the young people of the Eastern Legion, sneaking pictures of ...... ladies when they are sleeping.",
	"728881": "When I opened my eyes I was still in one of the rooms of the Steel Nest. There were people in defensive formation in front of me, and it was clear that they were not just some passing sycophants.",
	"728882": "From the atmosphere, I knew immediately that they were from the Eastern Legion.",
	"728883": "I'm sorry. But people who do their jobs well make sure they can show their accomplishments when they go out. So I thought I'd take some pictures to do the same.",
	"728884": "We are a private military contractor, in other words, we are outsourced personnel, not personnel of the Eastern Army. Therefore, the military's upper echelons are unaware of what we have done and the results we have brought about, and they don't take any responsibility for us.",
	"728885": "A flabby, well-spoken young man held out his hand. He seemed to intend to shake my hand, but quickly withdrew it.",
	"728886": "Oh, sorry. I know you have broken bones in both arms and legs. And yet, I couldn't resist the urge to shake your hand.",
	"728887": "I decided to get into this industry after watching your classes on guerrilla warfare on the Internet. So you are like a teacher to me.",
	"728888": "Did you see a pirated copy?",
	"728889": "It's for students. I downloaded it and deleted it within 24 hours.",
	"728890": "I observed and analyzed the current situation while chatting with her in vain.",
	"728891": "I just took this picture, which means that it hasn't been long since I was captured. The Five Great Armies are averse to sending military forces across borders with each other, even before the civil war. ......",
	"728892": "The Steel Nest is in the effective territory of the Southern Army, so normally, the girls would want to leave here as soon as possible. So it is highly likely that they have not been here for more than a few hours yet.",
	"728893": "Me, I have not had my armor removed, but this should not have been reserved for the mercenaries because I am a woman. There is one possibility. I didn't make it.",
	"728894": "If I risk further tearing of the skeleton, and bet on a single blow with the remaining battery, I might still have a chance of winning. The enemy leader is the recipient of a metal graft, so if I can take it and attach it to a substrate with the highest level of power output I have: ......",
	"728895": "You can make a big turnaround - you can do it.",
	"728896": "Okay, we still have a chance. Any other news? Oh yeah, where did Popo go?",
	"728897": "From the way the mercenaries are arranged in the room, it doesn't look like there are any soldiers outside to separately protect her, so surely that means she hasn't been captured?",
	"728898": "Yes, then it stands to reason that not much time has passed yet. The light stigmata are not invincible. If they use sonar or some other detection method, it is useless to hide yourself by optical means.",
	"728899": "...... Yeah, there's still a chance. I'm not going to end up here. There is still room for recovery.",
	"728900": "...... Well, I don't want you to call me sir. I mean, aren't you supposed to be good at hunting and dealing with enemy attacks? And you can't even catch a single girl.",
	"728901": "...... That thing is not just a girl. The most important thing to remember is that you don't have to be a good person to get the best out of your life. I'm not sure how much I'd like it if she just showed up out of the blue and started shooting at us.",
	"728902": "You may have underestimated her completely, but she is not so easy to deal with.",
	"728903": "I'm as upset as I thought I was. I knew it, Popo, I didn't catch it. Let's explore some more.",
	"728904": "That girl is not your average girl around here. Popo is ...... I don't know her real name yet, but that girl, if she had been born a few years earlier and entered military school, she would surely have developed the abilities of a division commander.",
	"728905": "The ability she has to execute and be resourceful with it is outstanding. She just doesn't have the experience yet to realize what she is.",
	"728906": "If only he could have the firm conviction and training, that boy, he could surely become a new legend. I assure you that I will do it with honor--",
	"728907": "Enough talk about that. Let's talk about your treatment, cold steel.",
	"728908": "According to our information, you escaped from the <color=#DC143CFF>Yucatan Big Dead Zone</color>, didn't you? --You're very lucky to have survived. But you have no idea what your First Corps is now because of that, do you?",
	"728909": "Division commanders belonging to the I Corps, plus all the senior officers, were put on trial and executed.",
	"728911": "The commander of the First Legion, and commander-in-chief of the World Legion in all but name--<color=#DC143CFF>Charisma Sunderland</color>has already been given the judgment she deserves.",
	"728912": "Now you're just a wolf ...... no, a stray dog, who doesn't know it even though you're already stuck and doomed, and still holds on to the illusion that you can return to your people.",
	"728913": "Uu......",
	"728914": "Now you know whose hand the trump card is in, don't you?",
	"728915": "Super shocking ........................... ......... is a lie, though.",
	"728916": "Besides, isn't it embarrassing to tell such a bullshit story?",
	"728917": "The giant crack of collapse ...... formally known as the dead zone ......The dead zone interferes with communications, but in my experience, the closer you get to the center of the dead zone, the more interference you get to the radio waves. The closer you get to the center of the dead zone, the stronger it gets.",
	"728918": "Even the latest battleships can't navigate normally at the back of the dead zone, so it's impossible to put a large force there, itself.",
	"728919": "The First Corps had the upper hand on the battlefield until I was caught in the dead zone, so there was no way they could have been destroyed just a few months after that.",
	"728920": "No one would believe such a ridiculous story unless it is exaggerated and acted out with great enthusiasm.",
	"728921": "Besides, he, our leader, is a very mysterious and monstrous person. I know that even the strongest people only have one life, but I can't even imagine dying for him.",
	"728922": "Charisma Sunderland is not the kind of person who dies quietly and in silence. People like that, even if they die, will light up the world, and there should be nothing anyone can do to stop them.",
	"728923": "(I should probably pull more information out of him now anyway.)",
	"728924": "Your ...... that statement, you didn't say that just to surprise me.",
	"728925": "State the terms of your employer.",
	"728926": "Hm.",
	"728927": "He smiled as if to say that the mercenary had done well. You're too quick to rejoice, ...... I'm still ready to fight, I'm still ready to fight.",
	"728928": "Hypothetically, hypothetically.",
	"728929": "There existed a certain legion. In the course of the civil war, that corps accidentally surrendered to the First Corps.",
	"728930": "Isn't that the Eastern Army?",
	"728931": "I'm just assuming that there was such a corps. I'll go on. Although that corps thought it had made the least risky and most effective decision for itself, the legendary Commander-in-Chief of Sunderland turned people's expectations on their head and lost the battle.",
	"728932": "In the end, the southern god of war was victorious, and the corps was sided with the wrong side. To regain its honor and reputation, the legion needed a card to play. And that card was you.",
	"728933": "So they need you, one of the founders of the First Legion, [cold iron], adoring cold sound ...... No, they need Iron Master Issatsu. I don't care what your name is. Anyway, they want you - to stand up in court, admit your guilt, and testify as a witness.",
	"728934": "They want you to admit that the First Legion started the civil war on its own and created the Yucatan Big Dead Zone, using cruel weapons to conquer and gain supremacy over all mankind. ......",
	"728935": "And I want you to admit that the First Legion did not receive any support from that legion, that that legion was smart enough to know that surrender was a lie, that that legion was in fact always on the side of justice.",
	"728936": "That way we can change the outcome of that corps and trial: ......",
	"728937": "The guilty cold iron is also released without charge because he is one of the members of a secret front by the Eastern Legion.",
	"728938": "You say it like it sounds, but I can see what you really mean. In other words, the Eastern Legion wants to tame me, a stray dog.",
	"728939": "What other choice do you have? You have no home to go back to. I think you should understand the situation better, Dr. Cold Iron. Profit is something that can only be gained by living. It doesn't matter how high the interest rate is if you don't have the principal.",
	"728940": ".............................. The hypothetical army you mentioned earlier, ...... how much ...... I'm also speaking hypothetically, but what kind of benefits would these cold iron and such enjoy? I mean, older people think about retirement a lot, don't they?",
	"728941": "The cold steel in that hypothetical story is really greedy. But on the other hand, I think she fits the atmosphere of the corps - she will be selected by the upper management of the corps and put in charge of the training of the troops. Well, there will be some supervision.",
	"728942": "I see. It may be over the top, but the whole world knows that the troops in the Eastern Legion are too weak to hold up even a little bit.",
	"728943": "It's not that burdensome. It's like a career change of sorts. Besides, you were already retired, weren't you? Initially, you worked for the Jinqiren, then you were assigned to the director of Shinshu, and then you joined the First Corps: ......",
	"728944": "It just adds the words \"Eastern Legion\" to the latest line of the history.",
	"728945": "............ Okay, I get it.",
	"728946": "Yes. ...... Can I ask one last question?",
	"728947": "Go ahead.",
	"728948": "How did you guys track me down? I don't think the guys from the Southern Stigmata Bureau would risk their lives for you, no matter how serious they are.",
	"728949": "Well, that's easy enough. Actually, there's a rumor going around inside the Southern Army. It is rumored that <color=#DC143CFF>Marshal Lavinia Avignon<color=#DC143CFF>, the god of war, is actually dead, and that the orders currently being issued are AI-composites of the Expeditionary Force command.",
	"728950": "Maybe the Southern Army's Central Expeditionary Force is doing so to stabilize the local warlords, or maybe the local warlords are spreading such rumors to undermine the legitimacy of the Central Army. Or it could be a conspiracy by the northern army or a ploy by the western army.",
	"728951": "I don't know if the rumors are true, but the information caused some generals in the southern army to panic and they were trying to ...... make new friends.",
	"728952": "That is why my employer was able to buy this information from the general in charge of the hunting party. After confirming through a commercial agent of the Stigmata Bureau that the information was correct, the request for this assignment came to us.",
	"728953": "When there is risk, don't you think it is wiser to be able to hedge against it?",
	"728954": "Indeed, I do. Then I will do so. I'm going to move in with the Eastern Legion.",
	"728955": "Then I held out my hand.",
	"728956": "Good. I'm sure we'll be able to cooperate well with each other in the future. By the way, what are you using for communication? I'd like to be your friend.",
	"728957": "The mercenary reached out his hand as he spoke flirtatiously.",
	"728958": "In your industry, do all the nicknames start with the letter A to appear as far forward as possible on the list?",
	"728959": "You know all this?",
	"728960": "Now.",
	"728961": "Artificial muscle ...... maximum output! Only one target.",
	"728962": "Popo, now!",
	"728963": "At that moment, the eyes of everyone in the room were drawn to my gaze like iron dust attracted by a magnet.",
	"728964": "It's now or never. We have one shot at this. We'll take this once-in-a-thousand chance and take him down with a single blow...",
	"728965": "What!",
	"728967": "You're trapped.",
	"728968": "Ugh--",
	"728969": "A desperate blow was prevented.",
	"728970": "My speed is supposed to be faster than this guy's. Why? Are you saying you knew about this guy in advance? No way. ......",
	"728971": "Here, bring that girl.",
	"728972": "The mercenary snapped his fingers, the door opened, and his men brought Popo in.",
	"728974": "You guys ...... have actually been--",
	"728975": "Bargaining and cajoling, that's what we do best. Doctor, did you know that it's been three days since you passed out before you woke up?",
	"728977": "I'm glad I took your class online. You have surpassed the level of your teacher.",
	"728978": "You ...... hooked me up for what?",
	"728979": "My client changed the terms. Originally, all we had to do was to capture you and bring you to them, but later they said they would pay us only after they knew whether or not you were willing to negotiate. So we had no choice but to stay up all night to come up with a plan.",
	"728980": "Do you know how long it took me to make this plan! I had to make a plan, and then I had to submit a plan, too. It's a tough time we live in.",
	"728981": "But finally ...... finally got this big mission done! And I'm sure I'll get some unexpected bonuses with this baby. Hahahaha--hahahahaha--hahahahahahaha!",
	"728982": "The mercenary seemed to stand up and speak, and then he laughed, as if his spirit was delirious after a long day of overtime work.",
	"728984": "This time ...... there's really no more depth, it's over.",
	"728985": "Oh yeah, give Dr. Cold Iron a sedative. Let's pull up.",
	"728986": "One of my men nodded and approached me, sedative in hand.",
	"728987": "I'm... done... so far. ...... and my journey. .................. ............",
	"728991": "So that's what that was about.",
	"728992": "Do you have any other information yet?",
	"728993": "No. ...... and above is all I saw at that time.",
	"728994": "I myself am not sure how I was able to obtain this information at that time .......",
	"728995": "As I recall, you kept thinking, \"If I can be of any help,\" and before you knew it, you had the information?",
	"728996": "I don't mind that part. I trust you.",
	"728997": "Now all the clues are connected. I finally know who the enemy is.",
	"728998": "If that's the case, maybe that man will join us. ...... Okay, we'll change our destination.",
	"728999": "We will be arriving at the neutral area soon. We'll have fake IDs ready for you, and you should leave here when you get there. It's not safe for you to be with us.",
	"729000": "Oh ...... yes ......",
	"729001": "Surely ...... there is no need to go along with the Director of Tsukasaido if you can't help Mr. Kurosawa himself anymore. ......",
	"729002": "So I finally quit a job I didn't like, but where do I go from here ......?",
	"729003": "What do I want to do now?",
	"729004": "Come to think of it, don't worry so much about your body. When you were brought in, you were in a state of cryo-sleep, but shot all over your body like a beehive.",
	"729005": "I made the appropriate ...... modifications to the body to save lives.",
	"729006": "You will soon see that their physical strength and resilience are far superior to that of ordinary humans.",
	"729007": "With that body you have now, it shouldn't be too difficult to survive in this world.",
	"729008": "Kikki--!",
	"729009": "You're here.",
	"729010": "Yes ...... goodbye ......",
	"729014": "No, no, no. ...... Wait a minute, wait a minute!",
	"729015": "Did I drop something?",
	"729016": "Why?",
	"729017": "Hm?",
	"729018": "Why did the moderator director help ...... me!",
	"729019": "I know too that I am insignificant, and I don't think that fact will change in any person's eyes.",
	"729020": "My heart was ...... trembling.",
	"729021": "After seeing something I shouldn't have seen, I was immediately shot and fell down. So I could not tell anyone what I saw before I passed out. So how did the director of the board know how it happened?",
	"729022": "You have only met Director Shishido by chance before that, right? And remodeling surgery must be very expensive, right? And why would he believe me when I am a ......?",
	"729023": "After hearing my question, the moderator director narrowed his eyes and tried to answer the question.",
	"729024": "My voice was trembling as I asked the question because ...... I already ...... somehow knew the answer... ...",
	"729026": "I don't believe in you, you know.",
	"729027": "I trust the judgment of my own people, you know.",
	"729028": "Subordinates: .......",
	"729029": "I am a member of the board of directors of the Japan Federation of Bargaining Associations. At that time, the atmosphere at the Federation was clearly strange, so much so that even you, an employee, noticed it. That is why I had secretly assigned a subordinate to gather information at the Federation's headquarters.",
	"729030": "What kind of subordinate collects that information? ......",
	"729031": "She was the best of the information gatherers and the owner of the ice stigmata. The girl's name was Mou Kan'on. Ostensibly, she was a receptionist at the Human Qi Federation headquarters, secretly gathering information for me.",
	"729032": "She didn't have any orders that night, but she went on a rampage. I also found out that she wasn't just a receptionist.",
	"729033": "Then, using a car, I managed to escape the pursuit and encirclement, escaped the human Qiren, and delivered you to me in a state of cryo-sleep, and shortly after, you ran out of strength and died without saying a word.",
	"729034": "...... adoration--",
	"729035": "I have no idea what on earth you are worth.",
	"729036": "But she was willing to give up her life to believe in you. So it's clear you are more important than you think.",
	"729037": "That girl .................. who used to joke around with me every day ......",
	"729038": "That girl who was so innocent as an adult and was always so kind to me: ......",
	"729039": "Seeing you in such pain makes me sigh all over again.\"",
	"729040": "In school, they were only together for a semester and that girl who had a ............ bright future ahead of her was ......",
	"729041": "'You believe I have telepathic psychic powers in the summer, don't you? That psychic power is telling me this. Someone cares about you more than you know!",
	"729042": "Did your adoration die for .................. me?",
	"729043": "Hmph, you get it now, don't you?",
	"729044": "How's that for awesome--your partner is",
	"729046": "I ...... that ...... me ......",
	"729047": "Is there anything else you would still like to know?",
	"729048": "",
	"729049": "You?",
	"729050": "I'm not good at fighting, I'm still not good at it! But I, I will try!",
	"729052": "No good.",
	"729053": "Please visit ......!",
	"729054": "Not until they tell us why.",
	"729055": "Iron Master Issatsu, why do you fight?",
	"729056": ".............................. I don't know either: ......",
	"729057": "I don't even know how to describe this feeling ...... myself.",
	"729058": "However, those three days I spent with Mr. Houraiji Kyuushou.",
	"729059": "I don't think I learned anything, yet I feel like I learned something. It's as if ...... she planted one seed in my heart.",
	"729060": "I thought my heart was nothing but a barren wilderness of soil, and that there was no way I could nurture its seeds and make it bloom.",
	"729061": "But I felt like adoration was telling me that I could do it.",
	"729062": "I can feel those seeds sprouting little by little myself.",
	"729063": "I ...... want to assert my opinion. Because there are things I don't like about the world today. Because I'm not happy with the current status quo, I want to take action too.",
	"729064": "Anyway, I want to change this world now!",
	"729066": "I'm sorry for your ....... I said something I don't understand all of a sudden.",
	"729067": "Cold iron.",
	"729068": "Yes?",
	"729069": "Have you ever seen a kung fu novel? In one of them, there is a mineral called cold iron. It was a meteorite that fell from outer space and was encased in ice.",
	"729070": "It's difficult to excavate because it's encased in ice.",
	"729071": "But if you can find it, you can create a weapon that can defeat anything.",
	"729072": "No matter how great your dreams and ideals are, it is difficult to achieve them if the sword in your hand is just iron - you need cold iron to achieve them.",
	"729073": "Iron Master Issatsu, you should be a cold iron.",
	"729074": "Cold Iron: ......",
	"729075": "I must say that you start later than others, your talent is mediocre, and your reason for fighting is private - but that's OK. If you can be the most solid cold steel of anyone ......",
	"729076": "It means you are one of us.",

	"729079": "I, I will carry your name on my back. Together we will see it all through to the finish line. ........................ Absolutely.",
	"729080": "Together, let's make this name \"Cold Steel\" - a legend.",
	"729082": ".................. Yes, Ado will be there for you the whole time. I shouldn't let my partner embarrass me. I'll be stronger than before and definitely keep moving forward.",
	"729083": "Uu........................... ...",
	"729084": "Let's think, we need to think fast. There's still an element somewhere that can get us out of this situation! We must not sleep. Don't stop. Don't give up thinking.",
	"729085": "Don't give up thinking even when you are in a desperate situation. I haven't given up on you and I haven't given up on you. Even if I lose contact with all my friends, I will fight.",
	"729086": "I still don't like this ridiculous and cruel world. I have to stand up against this world that makes popo shed tears--",
	"729087": "I haven't ...... finished ...... yet ......",
	"729088": "What the hell? Wait, you didn't accidentally hit me with saline or something, did you?",
	"729089": "I'm not-- I'm not done--",
	"729090": "This exterior has a self-destruct feature on the core. That might create a chance for Popo to escape. If I'm lucky, ...... I might not even die? The probability might be about 10%, though.",
	"729091": "There's 10%, right? Then I'll have to give it a try!",
	"729092": "The outcome of the battle is not important. The fact that we are still fighting like this is enough.",
	"729093": "A child who has traveled with me and does not yet know the meaning of life. I don't even know his real name yet. ...... popo.",
	"729094": "Core ...... command zero.",
	"729095": "You should see how I fight. Crying and just dying will not lead to a beautiful world. The only way I know how to make a beautiful world is this!",
	"729096": "Wait, cold steel. What are you doing!",
	"729097": "I don't need to ask. Watch ...... until I do something that lives up to the name of Cold Steel, Popo--you're a smart guy, so I'm sure you'll know what my eyes mean, right?",
	"729100": "Popo ......?",
	"729101": "Popo, when did you start giving ...... the same look?",
	"729102": "Don ！！！！！！！！",
	"729104": "What happened? An earthquake!\"",
	"729105": "Enemy attack, enemy attack!",
	"729106": "This is ...... maybe--",
	"729107": "The \"steel nest\" was in disarray, and dust was settling all around. There is a large hole in the ceiling.",
	"729108": "Something came down that hole: ......",
	"729109": "We are the Aoho Knights, affiliated with the Southern Legion of the World Guard, under the Knight Baron Lancaster.",
	"729110": "It is a powerful elite force in the Southern Legion, along with the hunters of disintegration.",
	"729111": "You are a bunch of small fry who are disrespecting the dignity of the knighthood for a pittance of money. In your own words: ......",
	"729112": "It's a trick, trick, trick again!",
	"729113": "Day 17 of the trip I don't know if it's day or night.",
	"729114": "41 hours after the defeat of the cold iron.",
	"729115": "If we don't get away fast, fast, fast--",
	"729116": "There are ...... people over there--",
	"729117": "I hear footsteps!",
	"729118": "That way? No, this way!",
	"729120": "Ugh--",
	"729121": "Will they ever find out? No, they might not. ...... They might still be okay!",
	"729122": "This steel nest looks like a giant labyrinth. It hasn't been repaired for a long time, so the passageways are blocked here and there, and the map of the facility is almost useless.",
	"729123": "But on the other hand, if I don't have somewhere to run or aim, they won't be able to find me.",
	"729124": ".................. should be fine here, right?",
	"729125": "Yeah ............ here!",
	"729127": "I can't believe they're suddenly shooting at us! But it's ...... funny. How could they track me so precisely? Cold Iron said that my optical concealment technique is meaningless if they use sonar. ......",
	"729129": "Bleepy! Beep-beep!",
	"729130": "Looks like it still works! I didn't think my repair skills would come in handy here: ......",
	"729131": "There were small devices of unknown use all over the steel nest, and I fumbled my way through them, activating them as I went.",
	"729132": "Now if we could only hide ourselves in the opposite direction of the sound: ......",
	"729133": "Let's do it here: ......",
	"729134": "I found a vent that had loosened a screw and was half open. I stretched out and managed to duck into it and quietly hid myself away.",
	"729135": "...... Come on, come on. You're tracking me by sound detection, and this is how I know if you're following me: ......",
	"729136": "Tattoo ...... Tattoo ......",
	"729138": "It comes towards me as I approach .......",
	"729139": "Yeah ............",
	"729140": "(You can hear ...... the sound of it in the distance, can't you? Go to ...... and get over there.)",
	"729141": "Hm.",
	"729142": "(I knew it wasn't!?)",
	"729143": "We have to run!",
	"729145": "Instinctively I pushed my body backward. Then my body slid along the ventilation system ducts and slid down to the bottom of the ducts - and then down to the bottom of the ducts.",
	"729147": "Don ！！！！！！",
	"729148": "The moment I left the original location of the duct, the opponent attacked me at that location.",
	"729149": "Ugh!",
	"729150": "In the dusty darkness, the head and limb joints rolled down the ducts, bumping here and there.",
	"729151": "(How in the world does ...... know where I am?)",
	"729152": "Ton!",
	"729153": "Ugh--gobble gobble gobble gobble gobble!",
	"729154": "The rolling body finally stopped. The impact of the bump dislodged the hand that was holding my mouth. I inhaled the dust all at once and for a moment I couldn't stop coughing.",
	"729155": "Ugh ...... here ......",
	"729156": "Is this ...... like a security surveillance room? Looks like it's still functional?",
	"729157": "Yes, I'm sure you can check from the ...... surveillance room, can't you? I'm sure I can find out who is after me at ......",
	"729159": "The surveillance room has a separate power supply, so you might be able to see it: ......",
	"729160": "By the way, what was the Steel Nest facility for in the first place? It's a huge scrap heap now, but how could it have been so well-equipped?",
	"729161": "But let's leave it at that for now and play back the surveillance camera recordings: .................. this one is broken, this one is broken, that one is broken, that one is broken, and that one is broken. ...... oh, here it is!",
	"729162": "A camera image marked 12F16C captured the other party. They are following me .................. and these clothes are ...... military of the Eastern Legion. The one the company is wearing...... but why?",
	"729163": "Oh well. If it were a cold iron, I would say this: ......",
	"729164": "The whole world is ...... all her enemies, she said.",
	"729165": "From the shape of it,...... there's no doubt,...... this mercenary is wearing a mask with sniff sensors on it,...... so it can detect my scent and follow me. They're following me.",
	"729166": "Is there anything I can do to cope? Do you think I can still hang in there?",
	"729167": "We have to get away somehow.",
	"729168": "As I was thinking this, my hand suddenly touched the doorknob.",
	"729170": "Still at ............",
	"729171": "Uu......",
	"729172": "........................ Let's give up now... .........",
	"729173": "I hadn't been able to eat for a long time and my strength had long since reached its limit. ......There may be a way to escape the olfactory sensors,......but what good is it if you can escape once or twice? But what does it matter if he escaped once or twice?",
	"729174": "In the end, they just keep chasing you. One after another, they are chased, they keep running away without a break, and in the end, they die in the back alleys looking as dirty as stray dogs, or maybe even more miserable - they are turned into experimental animals. ......",
	"729175": "If I had to live like that, I'd rather die ...... gracefully. ...... Cold Steel, I'm not a hero like you.",
	"729176": "It's like when you're running and you don't feel tired while you're running, but once you stop, you feel helplessly tired. Once the impending crisis is over, the thoughts that I didn't have time to think about come rushing back with a sense of dizziness and weakness.",
	"729177": "Yes, you can stay here forever. That way, everything will be safe and nothing will happen.\"",
	"729179": "I suddenly remembered the words of a man I had encountered earlier at the power plant, who had once been a man.",
	"729180": "Yes, why did I take the liberty of opening the door to that room at that time? And I even went so far as to suggest that I was going to save him. He was hoping to be shot to death by the cold steel or to rot away in a corner of that dimly lit room, wasn't he?",
	"729181": "Pa..................pa\"",
	"729182": "No ...... don't come out ......",
	"729183": "In the darkness, I felt as if it were my mother, the one whom I should have put into eternal sleep, the one whom I should have put an end to her suffering, yes, my mother. My mother was breathing raggedly, her voice sounding as if it were not a word.",
	"729184": "Ear ......",
	"729185": "\"It hurts so much...... it's like a bug is crawling around inside my head...... hurts......... ...quickly ...... how did you know ...... about me?\"",
	"729186": "Ohhhhhh ！！！！",
	"729187": "Don! Don! Don!",
	"729189": "You can't ...... anymore ......",
	"729193": "Gigi--gigi--!",
	"729194": "Ah--",
	"729195": "The display turned on, as if something had touched it without me noticing.",
	"729196": "Came to ............ beautiful ............... .........",
	"729197": "......The great ............ victory is ......... ...",
	"729198": "This is ...... maybe--",
	"729199": "The tragic era has already passed, and humanity has triumphed over fate!",
	"729200": "Wow!",
	"729201": "The images were glorious. Green mountains, a never-ending river, and a town. The people in the town were not helpless, but their faces were full of vitality and joy.",
	"729202": "Take a look. Our technology has come so far, our society is more peaceful than ever. There will never be another time in history as wonderful as these days.",
	"729203": "Is this from the ...... old time period? Is it from the Western Era?",
	"729204": "It's from a time when the Aftermath War hadn't yet broken out, when the collapse was victorious. It's a time when there hasn't yet been a civil war in the People's Qi Federation.",
	"729205": "What a ............ what a great ......",
	"729206": "To all those who love this era, we invite you to join us in our construction!",
	"729207": "The image suddenly stopped.",
	"729208": "Why are we stopping? Is there anything else?",
	"729209": "I want to see more. Just a little more ...... Not food or scenery or anything. What I want to see is those happy, joyful people--",
	"729210": "A video disc came out. Upon closer inspection, I saw that there were several discs in a container under the display. ...... The discs had the words \"Advertising 01\" and \"Advertising 02\" written on them.",
	"729211": "Thank goodness ...... is still there. ...... Oh!",
	"729212": "Most of it's cracked ...... broken ...... by the shooting earlier.",
	"729213": "The only one that was safe was the last one. It had \"Bot 03\" written on it.",
	"729214": "Even if it's a rejected one, it must be ....... ......?",
	"729215": "With that in mind, I put the disc into the machine.",
	"729216": "D-d-d-don! Da-da--dun!",
	"729217": "Oh, it's playing back.",
	"729218": "Take a look. Our technology has come so far and society is more ...... at peace than ever before.",
	"729219": "This ...... looks like the unedited version of the one you just posted.",
	"729220": "There will never be as beautifully ...... wonderful days as these days in the history of the past.",
	"729221": "But well, maybe it's not a bad idea to take another look at ......?",
	"729222": "So, to all those who love this era: ......",
	"729223": "That era. ......",
	"729224": "Stop, you're done. You can't even do a good job of a mere side note.",
	"729226": "I'll switch people and take another shot.",
	"729227": "I'm sorry ......",
	"729228": "This voice is ........................... ...cold...... iron.................. ......?",
	"729229": "It's not that I don't like you personally. I just think you have a little problem with your attitude toward your work. If you can't even do this well, do you think you can be trusted with important assignments?",
	"729230": "The script changed the day before the shoot, so it's not like I'm ...... ugh ...... wow ...... me, I'll do my best... ...",
	"729231": "That's enough, go. Don't bother your colleagues around you.",
	"729232": "This place is not ...... a nest of steel...... I see......",
	"729233": "So that's what that was about.",
	"729234": "That's right. After the World Guard raised its army and won the war, all the representative buildings of the former Jinki-ren were destroyed by an attack from a battleship in order to show a complete farewell to the old era of conflict and resentment, and the scene was broadcasted to the world.",
	"729235": "That's why. The reason this metal ruin looks so much like the one in the history book I learned about in ......7 grade.",
	"729236": "Ironmonger!",
	"729237": "is ...... yes!",
	"729238": "...... Enough already. You're so out of your depth that I'm going to have to get you a cup of coffee.",
	"729239": "Cold Iron used to be ...... really such an inconspicuous person?",
	"729240": "She called herself a legend or something, but from what I see here, I don't see any heroism at all.",
	"729241": "When I think about it, in all our travels together, she hasn't been very dependable at times. ...... Or, from this video, does that mean she was the same way before?",
	"729242": "Every time I didn't have the talent to be a hero, I had to fight against someone much stronger than me. From the split of the Human Qi Federation to the Aftermath War, and from the Aftermath War all the way up to now: ......",
	"729243": "Is this because her luck was bad to begin with?",
	"729245": "Or is it that she has chosen from herself the fate of always fighting?",
	"729246": "If so, what in the world ...... gives her the strength to keep fighting?",
	"729247": "What is there in your mind that I don't have?",
	"729248": "If so ...... if so ......",
	"729249": "If so, please contact ..................",
	"729250": "Ahhhh ...... when will these days ever end?",
	"729251": "Found it. That's Cold Iron's cell phone and bag. ...... I knew it was at that location, 02F07K's surveillance camera location.",
	"729254": "Huff...... smell is wafting from here?",
	"729255": "'Yes, the Steel Nest. It used to be the underground stronghold of the Jinki-ren.\"",
	"729256": "No more running away? Miss? Or have you already accepted your fate to die?",
	"729257": "I'll surrender to ....... I'm a sacristan. Please don't kill me. You could make a lot of money selling me out, couldn't you?",
	"729258": "Oh, my, you're so smart. I certainly have orders from my boss not to kill you. But ...... they didn't say you had to be in a state of five, did they?",
	"729259": "Right, why don't you entertain your sister? Scream and scare me some more! Look, I'm going to count to 30 seconds and then I'm going to come after you again. Maybe you'll get out of there in one piece?",
	"729260": "Why don't you just run away? I told you I'd make you suffer, I'd make you hurt.",
	"729261": "Please feel free to ....... I have a history of doing things that I would never forgive myself for, so I deserve to suffer and be hurt.",
	"729262": "Huf ............ so ......",
	"729263": "That's boring. So let's go now.",
	"729264": "Have you stopped hurting them?",
	"729265": "I quit.",
	"729266": "I don't really like to be abusive. I just do it because it makes my life more enjoyable to pretend I'm crazy.",
	"729267": "If you don't pretend to enjoy the cruelty of the situation, you will be left wondering why you are here hurting an innocent girl.",
	"729268": "So we have to accept the fact that we have to live in a cruel world for no ...... reason.",
	"729269": "That's the thing. So if you don't cooperate, I can't continue to deceive myself.",
	"729270": "I don't like this world after all. I would rather lose my life here.",
	"729271": "Haha, you're so open-minded, aren't you? I'm a little envious.",
	"729272": "Let's go.",
	"729273": "After saying this, the soldier took me to the far end of the aisle where my friends were.",
	"729276": "I made a call using the cell phone that Cold Steel had dropped.",
	"729277": "The number I called is the number of the Lancaster family's informant.",
	"729278": "The opponents are an arrogant and powerful aristocracy of stigmatic knights. They are said to be using industrial void printers installed in a floating fortress in the sky, larger than the battleship Moonlight Throne. It is said that the town's production is almost entirely based on the town itself.",
	"729279": "There is only one thing to negotiate.",
	"729280": "The item was originally supposed to be traded, and the owner of the Stigmata of Light, a girl called \"Popo,\" was taken away.",
	"729281": "[Time] is [Present].",

	"729283": "The [opponent] is a private military company (PMC) [not affiliated with a corps].",
	"729284": "I haven't ...... finished ...... yet ......",
	"729285": "So now is the time to ......",
	"729286": "What is it? Excuse me? You didn't accidentally hit me with saline, did you?",
	"729287": "When the raid--",
	"729288": "Don ！！！！！！！",
	"729289": "The powerful Stigmata nobles have a heavily armed force, the Mobile Knights, who are loyal only to themselves.",
	"729290": "What happened? An earthquake!\"",
	"729291": "Enemy attack, enemy attack!",
	"729292": "The Knights' most preferred form of appearance is this. First they sweep in with artillery fire, then they come down.",

	"729303": "The guys in the Eastern Legion are still as frail as ever.",
	"729304": "Gentlemen, the overwhelming military prowess of our Southern forces has once again been proven in this battle. I am glad that we did not betray the teachings of General Lancaster!",
	"729306": "Then ...... you're next.",
	"729307": "......What does this mean ......",
	"729308": "Are you the Cold Steel? I've heard that name somewhere. ...... You have no warrior's honor at all, not to cut off your stomach even though you've fallen into the enemy's tricks.",
	"729309": "Stigmata hunters, listen up. Things have already changed, and we are not going to accept the terms of our previous deal.",
	"729310": "As for the girl with the light stigmata, I will let you take her with you. And as a reward, I will spare your life for now. #While you are alive, you can at best go around telling people about the fame of the Order of the Knights of Aoho!",
	"729311": "...... No way. ......!",
	"729312": "Members of the Order of Aoho, we are leaving the Steel Nest and returning to \"Atlas\" ...... No, we have this girl, so let's call for a mobile ship. Let's go.",

	"729314": "...... popo! You didn't sell yourself to those guys, did you?",
	"729315": "What are you talking about, cold iron......, you knew this was going to happen from the beginning. You and I are the goods being sold and the seller in the first place.",
	"729316": "But does Popo really want to do that?",
	"729317": "Yes, ...... yes.",
	"729318": "Cold Iron, I haven't told you this for a long time, but I know. I can't forgive myself for my transgressions. I have selfishly allowed people to live who wanted to die because I was afraid of the unknown future.",
	"729319": "You and I are different to begin with. You may be the one who keeps running towards a goal all the time, but I'm the one who can't decide what I should be going for.",
	"729320": "Shipp has arrived ...... so much for the chatter. Let's go.",
	"729321": "So ...... goodbye. I hope your ...... ideals you strive for become a reality.",
	"729322": "........................ Okay, I get it.",
	"729323": "Goodbye, cold steel. I sincerely hope your dreams come true. ...... End the war. End this era in which we cannot live without twisting the very essence of human nature.",
	"729325": "Hey, stigmata hunter. Stop. Or I'll show you no mercy.",
	"729327": "I can't finish it yet. ...... Popo, are you sure you want to end up like this?",
	"729328": "Don't come any closer ......! Cold Steel, this is the ending I want. This is where it ends. You still have things to do, don't you?",
	"729329": "What people want isn't something you ...... just say, it's something you show ...... with your actions.",
	"729330": "Popo, from now on you just do what you want to do.",
	"729331": "You don't seem to understand even if I tell you. It seems he wants to die. Fire a volley.",
	"729332": "Don't--",
	"729334": "What the hell's going on? Hey, who turned off the lights?",
	"729335": "It is not because of the lighting. ...... They are attacking with firearms and you can't even see their fire.",
	"729336": "So, ...... anyway, you have to overwhelm the enemy with firepower first.",
	"729337": "Quickly ......, get out of there--",
	"729338": "Well ...... hey little girl. Stop using the stigmata immediately.",
	"729339": "I ...... ugh!",
	"729340": "All you have to do is stun them. Stop shooting all together. Enter the sweep: ..................?",
	"729342": "Hey ...... does anyone have a decay energy measuring device ...... mine is apparently broken?",
	"729343": "What is the ...... indication of ...... equipment that we have a division commander class in front of us?",

	"729351": "Captain, for some reason I can no longer fire my gun.",
	"729352": "The lights began to work again, but I was not injured. No bullets were being fired from the guns held by the members of the Knights, but instead, roses were streaking out of the muzzle of the guns.",
	"729353": "I couldn't be in better shape. Well, who wants to fight me now?",
	"729354": "Super easy. That was easy to clean up.",
	"729355": "This is not good. ...... anyone ...... A request for support from Aoho Knights Unit 3. ...... support required, wow!",
	"729356": "Hey, you know what? This place is called Steel Nest.",
	"729357": "A mediocre mercenary in the Eastern Army might not have been able to do it, but with the power of this sacrament, I can bury you, all steel-clad, in a nuclear shelter thousands of meters below the ground, where you will not hear a sound and slowly await your death.",
	"729358": "I ...... do ...... please do not do such an impulsive thing. Your Excellency the Cold Iron Lord,...... if you keep me alive, you will get money in exchange for my custody. I am not lying.",
	"729359": "Huh? I thought prideful warriors cut off their stomachs when they lose a battle?",
	"729360": "Please don't say such a thing. ...... If I am killed, the Stigmata Knights with sensing ability in the Aoho Knights will also sense it, and they will come after you. I'll be thinking of you--ahhhh!",
	"729361": "You're so loud. Well, you still have your uses. I'm more interested in...",
	"729362": "I then raised my hand up and gave it a grip.",
	"729364": "Ship has been grabbed by ......! You're still a remnant of the First Corps!",
	"729365": "If you don't stop talking, I'll embed it in the rebar. I can manipulate liquid metal, so I will soak it between the knight's armor and pour it through every hole in your body.",
	"729366": "I'm not even married yet. ...... Please don't miss this! I'll do anything.",
	"729367": "Well, then, you have a military intelligence terminal in the ship, don't you? Give me its access code.",
	"729368": "That's an act of betrayal. ...... Kick me, please kill me after all!",
	"729369": "Eh? I've never been called that before.",
	"729371": "QE3N-8B36...... Okay, I've got access to the Southern Command intranet.",
	"729372": "What the PMC mercenaries said, absolutely false.",
	"729373": "It's the battleship's smart core, searching for any and all information about the First Corps.",
	"729374": "--Search complete, took 0.00063 seconds.",
	"729375": "Come on, tell me the truth.",
	"729376": "Tell me what is really going on in this world today.",
	"729377": "My warriors, my friends ...... and what are my students doing now?",
	"729379": "Everyone ......",
	"729383": "Was it really ...... so?",
	"729384": "...... is terrible. Doesn't this mean I'm the only one left at ......?",
	"729385": "Suddenly I realized that before I knew it, tears were streaming down my face.",
	"729386": "No, this is just like the old days when I was a company stockbreeder, isn't it? Iron Master Issatsu, you are not the old Iron Master Issatsu anymore. You are a hero now.",
	"729387": "Don't cry. We must keep fighting.",
	"729388": "But what should we do? The corps has been completely destroyed, and rebuilding it now will not bring peace and order, but only more unnecessary wars.",
	"729389": "I don't know what I'm supposed to be moving towards now. ...... I want to keep moving forward, but even if I manage not to die if I keep moving forward, that girl won't. What should I do?",
	"729390": "I need to show her more hope. A child like her should not be forced to live in a world like this. A child who is already burnt out and ashes should not have to face the cruel reality all over again.",
	"729391": "How can there be such a thing as a life spent like dust and dying like ashes?",
	"729392": "She should see more wonderful things, make friends worth keeping for life, experience trials and triumphs, and ...... not be rubbed up against people like a tool and passed from person to person like a thing! She shouldn't be ...... like that.",
	"729393": "There is still a way. ...... It's the core of the battleship's command, displaying recent important information.",
	"729395": "This ...... this information ...... no way?",
	"729398": "Ugh ............ my head hurts ......",
	"729399": "Please help me: ......",
	"729401": "The mobile knight who had been flying high earlier was now stuck to the wall like a cockroach attached to a cockroach whip. The mechanical armor he wears and the wall have completely merged into one.",
	"729402": "The whole area is a mess. It seems that both the PMCs of the Eastern Army and the Knights of the Southern Army have already been defeated.",
	"729403": "Where is the cold iron?",
	"729404": "As she made her way through the dimly lit corridors of the steel nest, the sun was shining through a hole in the ceiling created by the ship's gunfire. She stood in the sun that had formed there, alone in her thoughts.",
	"729405": "Oh, you're awake. Popo.",
	"729406": "Yeah. But I told you, ...... you don't have to help me.",
	"729407": "Well, I wanted to do it myself, and I was in a situation where I could, so I did. There will be plenty of time to complain in the future, and you can say as much as you want when you have time again.",
	"729409": "And then you've got the ...... stigmata implants, so where are you going to go from here? How are you going to rebuild the First Legion?",
	"729410": "What I had done was pointless.",
	"729412": "The First Corps no longer exists. Everything I have done has been for nothing.",
	"729414": "So ...... still ......",
	"729415": "I knew I shouldn't have made such an effort - is that what you would have said?",
	"729416": "I have paid a heavy price, hurt many people, broken many bones, and finally arrived at the end of the road and got no reward. I really don't want to live like this! It's like playing a video game! I'm returning it!",
	"729417": "Would you say that if you were me?",
	"729418": "But that's exactly what it is, isn't it?",
	"729419": "Yes, indeed. But I, still, will not stop moving forward.",
	"729420": "......Why?",
	"729421": "What can I say ...... because I like myself that way?",
	"729422": "Even if I no longer have a goal to aim for, I want to continue to act.",
	"729423": "I used to work for a company a long, long time ago. I was bullied by people around me, and I didn't have the courage to do anything that would stand out.",
	"729424": "Back then, I thought that as long as I followed the accepted rules of society, nothing would change in my daily life.",
	"729425": "But I don't like myself like that. ...... I can't believe how far away from the past this is now, can you?",
	"729426": "Believe.",
	"729427": "What?",
	"729428": "I ...... believe that you used to be someone who couldn't do it at all.",
	"729429": "It kind of hurts me when people say that. But, well, I left that kind of life behind, and I left a life where nothing had changed. And I paid the price.",
	"729430": "Otherwise, I could not stop my self-hatred. I hated myself for my weakness, my self-deprecation, and my willingness to do as I was told. I acted so that I would not hate myself.",
	"729431": "Popo, do you like yourself now?",
	"729432": "Why I like ...... ......",
	"729433": "I don't think you have to always want to wipe yourself out like that.",
	"729434": "But I don't know what it is about myself that makes me think ...... I like myself.",
	"729435": "That's what you have to look for. In my grandmother's experience, if you find yourself like that, you will naturally start to not allow yourself to not be like that.",
	"729436": "Then ...... what do we do now?",
	"729437": "Popo, have you heard of the legend of Site-01?",
	"729438": "Legendary is ...... that thing?",
	"729439": "If all Sacred Stigmata users, all the people of the world, would travel to the Holy Land and gather at the Holy Monument at Site-01: ......",
	"729440": "Salvation.",
	"729441": "It's like being saved. I was just thinking about heading over there next. I was thinking of making it the final destination of my trip.",
	"729442": "Will they be saved?",
	"729443": "Do you want to be saved? Or do you feel like there's nothing you can do? Tell me. We're not just commodities and sellers of trade anymore. How about you come on the road with me?",
	"729444": "I ...... I ......",
	"729447": "I'll try!",
	"729448": "I want to know how I can learn to accept myself, and I, I want to find out what is worthwhile for me!",
	"729449": "I'll go with you!",
	"729450": "Hoon ......",
	"729451": "Good! The journey continues. Let's set off for <color=#DC143CFF>Changku City</color>!",
	"729452": "Changkuu--what? Changkuu city?",
	"729453": "You don't know?",
	"729454": "Site-01 used to be called <color=#DC143CFF>Long Sky City</color> by the people.",
	"729455": "Night of the 18th day of the trip.",
	"729456": "Are you sure you're okay?",
	"729457": "It's okay, it's okay. I can already run and jump. You see...",
	"729458": "Ha! Great performance.",
	"729459": "Is this the power of the metal stigmata?",
	"729460": "Not everyone can do so much with this sacrament. It's not that I'm putting a lot of effort into this, it's just that I'm manipulating the armor that I have on.",
	"729461": "Like a puppet?",
	"729462": "Yes.",
	"729463": "Self-directed: ......",
	"729464": "Popo, popo, look and see!",
	"729465": "What? Wow! The can opened itself!",
	"729466": "Isn't it amazing? And let's manipulate the spoon too - well, it doesn't make it taste any better, but tonight's dinner is canned beef with non-contact cooking!",
	"729467": "Beef or ...... I remember a set of steaks I had before. I wonder if I can eat that again someday......",
	"729468": "Oh, I'm just remembering, so don't worry about it.",
	"729469": "I wonder when ...... it will be. But I'm sure you'll get to eat it someday.",
	"729470": "Alright, I'll use the time I've got simmering in the pot to explain a few things.",
	"729471": "The Site-01 we are aiming for, in other words, is <color=#DC143CFF>City of Long Sky</color>.",
	"729472": "According to information obtained from the Southern Command's intranet, the city of Chang Ku is currently under the jurisdiction of the military.",
	"729473": "About three months ago, a huge technological facility suddenly appeared in Changku City, and the entire citizenry was evicted from the city when the Southern Army announced that it would be placed under military jurisdiction.",
	"729474": "Do you mean that the technical facility is the ...... so called holy monument?",
	"729475": "Given the current situation, you're probably right. The information you've been hearing so far is either coming from the deported Changkuu citizens or has been passed down to you by word of mouth.",
	"729476": "The city is now a complete military fortress, so to speak, with special forces stationed there under the direct command of the Commander of the Southern Legion. The size of the force is roughly 30,000 people. But there should be no General's Guard.",
	"729477": "The General's SS?",
	"729478": "The Commander of the Southern Legion, who earned the title of Marshal for her great contribution to the War of the Aftermath. She is the only one in the world. She is surrounded by a group of soldiers called the SS. With my current strength, it is almost impossible for me to defeat the SS. Fortunately, they are not in Chang Kuo-City.",
	"729479": "So that means you can't drive a vehicle in like you used to.",
	"729480": "Yes, it's hard to get in the front door. It's hard to get in the front door or infiltrate. Our only advantage is that no one yet knows we are going to the Long Sky City.",
	"729481": "Ee: ......",
	"729482": "Well, strengths would be of little use. <color=#DC143CFF>Marshal Lavinia Avignon</color>is said to be a war genius, and his direct troops are composed of the strongest elite.",
	"729483": "It's nothing at all compared to the wariness of the aristocratic troops earlier.",
	"729484": "Wait, ...... I've always thought it was odd, but what kind of being is ...... a stigmatic aristocrat in the Southern Legion?",
	"729485": "I've always wondered why we have aristocrats in this day and age.",
	"729486": "Yes, I think so.",
	"729487": "In fact, the aristocracy has never disappeared and has always existed. It's just that it has become less noticeable with the changing times.",
	"729488": "You do know that in order to defeat the Human Qi Federation and the World Qi Federation, the first general commander of the World Guard raised his army on the front lines and created the First Corps by absorbing soldiers from both sides, right?",
	"729489": "Yes. And less than a year later, you defeated the two poles of the earth and opened up a new world.",
	"729490": "But you do realize that just because they defeated the human Qiren, it doesn't mean they executed all the soldiers who stubbornly resisted to the end, right?",
	"729491": "Yes.",
	"729492": "Later, the units that responded to the raising of the army and those that returned to the corps were integrated and organized into the four major corps that protect various parts of the world.",
	"729493": "Then, breaking with the culture of the past, a simple name based on direction was adopted for each corps, based on the principle that the corps belonged to all mankind.",
	"729494": "You have the Eastern Army, Western Army, Southern Army, and Northern Army .......",
	"729495": "Yes. However, not long after the establishment of the World Corps, the first Commander-in-Chief was assassinated, leaving his post vacant. Charisma Sunderland, the son-in-law of the first Commander-in-Chief, was assigned to investigate the death of the Commander-in-Chief.",
	"729496": "Is that person ...... that?",
	"729497": "That's right. The current head of the I Corps, and the second and fourth Commander-in-Chief of the World Legion. His research revealed that many remnants of the old world were plotting to overthrow the Corps' rule, and Commander-in-Chief Sunderland started a quiet war.",
	"729498": "Internally, it was called the Silent War. Finally, the Southern Legion, which had the most independence, became the host, uniting forces with different philosophies and a certain amount of power.",
	"729499": "So the Southern Legion became the strongest military force. But it also became a very complicated situation with constant factional struggles within it.",
	"729500": "Some of them are from the old Jinki-ren, some are from the Jinkai-ren and Seiki-ren, and some are former war maidens.",
	"729501": "They didn't agree with the beliefs of the World Legion and would only follow a strong leader, but the leader of the Southern Legion was probably the strongest sacramental user in the world at the time. As long as the Commander's girlfriend was around, the Southern Legion was undeniably strong.",
	"729502": "If you are interested in various buildings and collections from the A.D. period, when the concept of a nation-state still existed, you will find many in the southern cities.",
	"729503": "At the same time, there are still some concepts and customs in the South that are long outdated.",
	"729504": "The aristocracy didn't actually exist until the civil war. It began when the Southern armies adopted the ritual of giving titles and awards to people who had made great contributions, as monarchies had done in the past.",
	"729505": "The escalation of the human civil war made it necessary to mobilize more sacramentalists to prepare for the mainland war after the main frontline forces were destroyed, and so what had begun as a title of honor gradually developed into a true aristocracy.",
	"729506": "And with the advancement of void printer technology, it became possible for a competent scar user to build a battleship like one small world that could stand alone, with almost no logistical support. And things have been irreversibly progressing ever since.",
	"729507": "...... I got the general idea.",
	"729508": "I had always thought that the aristocracy was something that happened long ago in history.",
	"729509": "When certain conditions are met, no matter how outdated things are, they can be resurrected. In a nutshell, the most distinctive feature of the Southern Legion is that, although it has a strong military, it has a forest of factions within it, and there is disharmony between the central army and the local armies. Okay, end of lecture.",
	"729512": "What do you mean the lecture is over? Why did you suddenly freeze in that position?",
	"729513": "............ Huh? Maybe ...... yeah ...... could work?",
	"729515": "Me, I think I may have come up with a way to get into the Long Sky City.",
	"729516": "How do you get in?",
	"729517": "I'll clear my head for a moment: ......",
	"729519": "Yeah ...... yeah ...... sure seems like this is the most likely way to make it work.",
	"729520": "So what kind of method is that?",
	"729521": "Yeah, ...... means the next round is already over.",
	"729523": "No rush, no rush. Before I explain, I have something for you.",
	"729524": "I ran at once through the back streets and plunged into the darkness.",
	"729525": "I got you, Qin-kun.",
	"729526": "Dr. Kantetsu, fully armed, was standing leaning against the wall on the escape route I had planned in advance, and he spoke to me.",
	"729527": "Huh, you caught me before class was over. You lost. You're buying tonight at the cafeteria.",
	"729528": "...... teachers get free food in the cafeteria, right?",
	"729529": "What are you talking about? I'm just saying that you just came from a different school and I thought it would be good for us to talk and get to know each other better. Or maybe you don't like talking to your aunt?",
	"729530": "Sorry ......",
	"729531": "Dr. Kantetsu sighed and pinched my cheek lightly, somewhat angrily.",
	"729532": "You haven't done anything wrong. Why do you apologize so often?",
	"729533": "I'm sorry, it's just--",
	"729534": "Wrong again.",
	"729535": "That ...... me, me ......",
	"729536": "Pfft, just kidding. Today is on me, Qin-kun.",
	"729537": "But first, tell me: ......",
	"729538": "You have a remote control on your hip that can remotely control a smart machine gun. Why didn't you use it?",
	"729539": "Sorry. Professor Karma didn't like smart weapons, so that's why ......",
	"729540": "So you thought I wouldn't like to be used too? But since we're supposed to be enemies with each other, why should I care about my enemies?",
	"729541": "Sorry, I'll be careful next time. ......",
	"729542": "But was it really ...... so? Apparently, what you're saying doesn't sound true?",
	"729543": "I think I found it: ......",
	"729544": "Meow~\"",
	"729545": "Oh, no.",
	"729546": "Cat.",
	"729547": "You, you noticed this girl and got lost, didn't you? Not sure if you should sacrifice one cat for a final exam grade?",
	"729548": "I'm so sorry ......",
	"729549": "...... who are you.",
	"729550": "Are you, by any chance, very unsure of yourself?",
	"729551": "But you know in your heart what is right and what is wrong, don't you? You know which is more valuable, the cat or the certificate, the victory or the bloodshed.",
	"729552": "Oh yeah, you wrote in your mid-term report a suggestion for a place to use in education, didn't you? I really liked that one, didn't I?",
	"729553": "You have such a firm grasp of your own thoughts, so why don't you say them out loud? Why do you keep apologizing?",
	"729554": "Even ...... is more about what everyone thinks is right than what--",
	"729555": "--because I think it's the right thing to do.",
	"729556": "Yes.",
	"729557": "Is it a father-mother relationship?",
	"729558": "I guess I lost track of what was right after my father died early and my mother remarried a powerful military official.",
	"729559": "Should we be angry? Or should we bless them? Or should we curse them? I don't know what the right thing to do is.",
	"729560": "So I left home myself, ran away from my family, and came to a first corps school that I didn't know well. Because that way I could act as if the changes at home had never happened.",
	"729561": "The .................. doctor is truly amazing.",
	"729562": "But am I qualified to decide what is right and what is wrong?",
	"729563": "If everyone else is right, I might as well be right, right?",
	"729564": "I think that if you express opinions that differ from others, you can easily become isolated and nothing good will come of it.",
	"729565": "Before ......, I too thought I was of some special significance in this world.",
	"729566": "He said he is the one and only and is loved by his ...... father and mother.",
	"729567": "But I already figured it out. ...... sir?",
	"729568": "Meow.",
	"729569": "Dr. Kantetsu was so engrossed in playing with the cat, as if he had not heard me.",
	"729570": "Dr. ......?",
	"729571": "I knew......that this teacher would be something different from what I've seen so far,......but he also ended up being a great teacher about me and other things,......",
	"729572": "Meow~ You are so cute!",
	"729573": "Meow~~",
	"729574": "Qin Kun.",
	"729575": "Yes.",
	"729576": "Then kill this cat.",
	"729577": ".................. eh?",
	"729578": "If what everyone says is right is right, then shoot this cat and me with a smart weapon to get a good grade on the final exam.",
	"729579": "If you do, I will give you an A+ grade. If I don't, you fail the final exam.",
	"729580": "Great power to everyone you say, isn't it? So, what do we do now?",
	"729583": "Qin, people are weak creatures. That's why they try to unite. But sometimes people's personalities are incompatible with each other. That's why they hide what they really think in their hearts and try to unite the myriad forces that are mixed up in their minds.",
	"729584": "Therefore, the direction in which the combined forces ultimately head may not necessarily be the direction in which each individual wants to go.",
	"729585": "What would you do if that combined power were to confront you as an enemy in the future? Would you submit? Or will you stand up against it?",
	"729586": "It's a peaceful time, and I'm just an ordinary student. I'm not sure about those issues. ......",
	"729587": "Is that so?",
	"729588": "Meow~!",
	"729589": "The cat was rubbing up against the teacher's shoes as if to spoil it. The cat's defenseless tummy turned toward me as the teacher held it.",
	"729590": "If you don't do it right, you, someday you will have to kill this cat.",
	"729591": "You'll lose everything.",
	"729593": "--[Attention, entire crew, we have arrived in Site-01 airspace.] --",
	"729594": "Uu......",
	"729595": "I really don't like people's subconscious. It collects only the sharpest fragments of the past and unknowingly hurts us.",
	"729596": "-- [The platoon commander of the \"hounds\" platoon of the hounds under the command of Major General Karos, hound 01, please come to the conference room to participate in the operational briefing.",
	"729597": "Yes, sir.",
	"729598": "Before I took off my mask and left the room, I looked out the window.",
	"729599": "Below us stretches what used to be called the Long Sky City. And the skies there are filled with the battleships of each fleet.",
	"729600": "They all rallied for the sake of one being.",
	"729602": "Hound 01, arrived.",
	"729603": "Captain Qin, I am confident that you will be able to accomplish this important mission.",
	"729604": "The General is still ......",
	"729605": "That's right. We, the troops of the Central Expeditionary Force, are still in the process of restoring order at the I Corps' former base. I am unable to take command there this time.",
	"729606": "Yes, sir. Please explain your assignment.",
	"729607": "First of all, I'm sure you're aware that for the past month or so, a former high-ranking official of the First Corps named \"Cold Iron\" has been going around raiding Southern Corps bases in various locations.",
	"729608": "On the other hand, those in the Eastern Legion who lost the metal stigmata to her are refusing to acknowledge the fact of the cross-border military operation and are refusing to provide data on the implanted body that would allow the owner's location to be calculated.",
	"729609": "Therefore, this time, as in the war against the First Corps, we need to do everything on our own.",
	"729610": "The technical department is analyzing the behavior and destination of the cold iron, and according to the person in charge, the cold iron has been searching for directions to Site-01, or Changkuo City, on multiple terminals so far.",
	"729611": "This means that although we have not yet caught sight of Kangetsu at the moment, we are almost certain that her destination is Changku City.",
	"729612": "So this time, they decided to conduct a joint operation under the code name <color=#DC143CFF>\"Holy Monument\"</color>. Its purpose is to capture the cold iron and extinguish the spark of guilt completely.",
	"729613": "<color=#DC143CFF>\"Holy Monument\"</color>? It is, I believe, that ...... that can suppress resonance.",
	"729614": "That's right. A \"resonance\" like phenomenon that occurred around the world after Charisma Sunderland, the arrogant First Legion Commander, created the Yucatan Big Dead Zone and destroyed the Western Legion.",
	"729615": "Many smaller dead zones spread inside the city as if in resonance. Among them, Changku City, where there was a massive explosion of disintegrating energy, was the most severely affected.",
	"729616": "So we, the central army in the south, dispatched a special unit directly under our command to check the situation and found that something called <color=#DC143CFF>\"holy monument\"</color> had appeared from the general public.",
	"729617": "What was ...... its identity after all?",
	"729618": "He was called <color=#DC143CFF>\"Anchor of Eternity\"</color> during his interactions at the upper levels.",
	"729619": "I'm actually good friends with General Dolores of Special Forces Command, but she hasn't even told me what it is.",
	"729620": "The only thing we know is that the appearance of the Eternal Anchor has stopped the expansion of the dead zone in Changku City, which had been continuing until then. Smaller dead zones and eternal anchors have also appeared in certain towns in the East.",
	"729621": "It is strange how those in the Eastern Army do things. Instead of removing citizens from towns and placing them under the jurisdiction of the military, they have adopted the method of fire inspections and repairs to stores in the vicinity where permanent anchors have appeared.",
	"729622": "There is little reliable information available for the west and north, as they are blocked by the ...... Yucatan Big Dead Zone, but the satellite data still seems to indicate the appearance of a permanent anchor as well.",
	"729623": "But other than that, who created that thing in the first place? What kind of power does it have other than the suppression of resonance? General Dolores has no answers to these questions. We also don't know who gave it the name <color=#DC143CFF>\"Anchor of Eternity\"</color>.",
	"729624": "I'm also wondering if ...... might have been created by the man at the top of his game.",
	"729625": "The one at the top? What ......oh ...... General ...... General are you talking about ......<color=#DC143CFF>General</color> are you talking about?",
	"729626": "Well, let's leave it at that. The mission I'm about to hand off to you and this is another story.",
	"729627": "This mission, however, will be a great display of your power as a hound dog. You will cooperate with the defense forces of Changkuu City to capture the cold iron.",
	"729628": "Site-01 is a very ordinary town, so the most likely destination for the enemy would be the Eternal Anchor.",
	"729629": "Therefore, during the mission, pay special attention to the situation of the Eternal Anchor and be vigilant. Also, gather as much information and data on the Eternal Anchor as possible.",
	"729630": "I understand.",
	"729631": "I have already informed General Dolores of the Special Forces Command about you. That's all for the briefing.",
	"729632": "May I have a moment?",
	"729633": "What is it?",
	"729634": "General, before I came here, I also checked the status of the troops mobilized this time.",
	"729635": "Currently, all the troops that can be seen through the window are only those who are in the position of observers, if you ask the local military ...... themselves.",
	"729636": "You need to better understand the sincere hearts and minds of the local military generals. You understand that we are currently in a sensitive period where the Central Expeditionary Force is in the outer regions. At a time like this, they cannot take the potentially problematic action of stationing troops in a city under the jurisdiction of the central army without a clear reason.",
	"729637": "They can only send observers in name only. Therefore, the only unit that can actually provide support in this operation is a unit belonging to the Central Command, you and your hound platoon.",
	"729638": "But don't worry. They may be just observers now, but once the cold iron appears, the local divisions will have enough reason to cooperate with the defense forces in Changku City.",
	"729639": "The other side is that cold-iron ...... legendary generation. Their ability, can never be underestimated.",
	"729640": "Forgive me if I may have gone too far with that ...... statement. Then why don't you send someone at the division commander level?",
	"729642": "Cold Iron has already obtained a metal Stigmata implant, and now only tactics based on sheer numbers can stop her. Even a stigmatic knight could be beaten, but a divisional commander--",
	"729643": "............ Captain Qin",
	"729644": "Are you questioning the courage and willpower that we, the military men and women of the South, possess?",
	"729646": "No, that is not what I meant at all.",
	"729647": "Although he is a cold iron, he is just an old retired teacher. Our Southern Army's pride in its military might is absolute. Captain Qin, you seem to have a little problem with your mindset.",
	"729648": "Don't trust your own decisions unnecessarily. The command sees farther and understands more than you do, and one of your men was killed in action two months ago because of your misdirection.",
	"729649": "That's not true. She died because the ...... artillery unit decided to bombard the area she was in and didn't contact her.",
	"729650": "She was quite young, but I believe her name was ......e, e......",
	"729651": "Eliza West.",
	"729652": "Yes, let's put it this way. Until the cold iron shows up, you will remain on this battleship as proof that the central army will tacitly approve of actions by the local divisions.",
	"729653": "Sir, please let us go out. We hunters of disintegration, as they call us Dogs, would rather fight on the ground than fly around--",
	"729654": "I have golf in the next few days. ...... What? What? Urgent meeting? Okay. Well, I'll leave it at that.",
	"729655": "Pic: ------",
	"729657": "I felt a similar thing in my mind as the pitch-black shadow projected on the ground by the huge battleship that I had seen earlier when I looked at the Changkuo City from above.",
	"729658": "Where did this dark feeling arise from? Was it because I met Dr. Kantetsu again? Or is it because I met that girl who gave me strength? Even though that girl gave me strength, I pointed the muzzle of my gun at her.",
	"729659": "Or was this pitch black thing originally from a corner of my mind?",
	"729660": "It is not difficult to imagine that the local troops gathered from the situation General Karos mentioned are not here for ...... interest, but their real purpose is to study the Eternal Anchor in Changku City.",
	"729661": "I didn't realize that the local divisions were so interested in this. What secrets are there in the Eternal Anchor?",
	"729662": "There are those who are still unskilled in the feudal system, those who want to rebuild the ...... country, and the remnants of the human Qiren. They have not been able to absolutely obey orders from the corps headquarters to date.",
	"729663": "They fear that there is some secret in Changkuo City, where a decisive force exists that would allow the central forces to overwhelm the provinces. At the same time, however, they do not dare to overtly defy the central government's instructions.",
	"729664": "That is why the local armies that have gathered need us, who belong to the central army, as a presence to prove and see to it that they are granted access to the city of Changkuu. For them, the cold iron is only secondary.",
	"729665": "...... Do they really know how dangerous cold iron is?",
	"729666": "No wait ...... If that's the case, why would General Karos go to such lengths to cooperate with the local division's actions?",
	"729667": "Do you not envision the possibility of being held accountable by Marshal Avignon for doing such a thing?",
	"729668": "What does that mean? Are we to assume that the general's backers in the upper echelons have been disqualified? It's not like local divisions don't send out division commanders for operations like this one: ......",
	"729669": "Ah!",
	"729670": "For a moment, I felt a jolt of electricity, and the black clouds hanging over my head cleared.",
	"729671": "This is a very bad omen. There is only one possible outcome. And it is a terrible possibility.",
	"729672": "Recently, a rumor has been circulating in the Expeditionary Force headquarters for some time. But I had always refused to believe it, thinking that such a thing was impossible.",
	"729673": "By any chance, ...... we, the <color=#DC143CFF>Marshal of the Southern Legion<color=#DC143CFF>Marshal<color=#DC143CFF>, as ...... rumor has it... ...",
	"729674": "Are you saying that he is already ...... deceased?",
	"729675": "That's ridiculous......It can't be possible......<color=#DC143CFF>Marshal</color>His Excellency is a very mysterious and miraculous woman, and she's also a very mysterious and miraculous woman. ......I believe she was talking about it on TV the other day......",
	"729676": "But if that is the case, it all makes sense. Then the reason the officers of the Central Expeditionary Force suddenly became subordinate to the local divisions is because the top general is dead, and the fact that the top brass is hiding the fact is because they are concerned that if it surfaces, the supply lines may be cut off by the local forces.",
	"729677": "Division commanders of local armies are reluctant to participate in the defeat of the cold iron themselves, and are also hesitant to dispatch the Knights of the Stigmata. ......",
	"729678": "To advance preparations for civil war.",
	"729679": "Ugh. ......!",
	"729680": "I felt myself shuddering to the point of nausea. I propped myself up against the wall and tried to digest the results of my series of musings.",
	"729681": "Are we going to keep fighting more? Civil war in the human race followed by civil war in the southern army. Does that mean peace won't last six months? ......",
	"729682": "No, we should be calm here for once. The thoughts I just had are just guesses in my head.",
	"729683": "Yes, we need to chill out. This is an illusion. Yes, just an illusion. Like a bad dream, painful but harmless.",
	"729684": "Think about it calmly. Our <color=#DC143CFF>General</color> would never lose his life in battle. Besides, people are sick and tired of war, and there should be no need for more fighting.",
	"729685": "We must calm down. Fear without reason is not worth a penny. Unnecessary thoughts will only hinder you from carrying out your duties as a soldier. All you have to do is to carry out your assigned mission.",
	"729686": "Yes, we need to tell the children about the contents of Operation .......",
	"729687": "And we must fulfill our mission.",
	"729688": "(That's what I am. Captain of the Honorable World Builder Corps Southern Army, Hunters Platoon, and Defender of Mankind, as I should be.)",
	"729690": "(The top brass have their own ideas. I will do my duty as a soldier and protect the people I care about.)",
	"729691": "(Both the teacher and the people of the ...... First Corps were pursuing an ideal, trying to create an ideal world that would inspire all people to change.)",
	"729692": "(But how many lives would be lost if every single person in the world were to develop their own arguments and push their own dreams?)",
	"729693": "My thoughts must be right ......Dr. Cold Iron, this time it's your turn to win ......Now it's my turn to go after you.",
	"729694": "Let's go to .......",
	"729696": "I stood by the window.",
	"729697": "Hounds 03, 05, and 07 are present.",
	"729698": "This time the target has the light and metal stigmata, which means he has to change his equipment. ......",
	"729699": "Hound 03, go to the conference room and assemble.",
	"729700": "Dad, I thought you went to a briefing, but you came back with such a bitter look on your face. My father has a tendency to be too serious, and that's why he worries about things like that. He said that in this day and age, in order not to go crazy, you should try to live with a little humor in your life.",
	"729701": "If you say that kind of degrading words again, I will discharge you as soon as the war is over and send you to a boarding high school.",
	"729702": "(Martin Hanover aka Hound 03. He's the recipient of a heavily equipped transplant. His nickname is Idea King. He is the brightest guy in the hound platoon and I like talking to him a lot.)",
	"729703": "Hmmm. When you come to a high place, your mood naturally becomes more joyful.",
	"729704": "Hound 05, meet in the conference room.",
	"729705": "Dad, you look kind of glum. Why don't you have some tea?",
	"729706": "Thank you. I'll take that as a sign of goodwill. Now it's just a meeting.",
	"729707": "Yeah, okay - if there's anything you don't like, you can always tell me.",
	"729708": "(Kim Hacek, aka Hound 05. He is the recipient of a rock stigmata implant. His nickname is a good listener. He's always available if you're having a bad day.)",
	"729709": "And and and and and and father!",
	"729710": "I kind of feel like I'm going to fall down listening to this. We'll meet in the conference room.",
	"729711": "Sorry. I just wanted to let you all know about ......",
	"729712": "Don't worry, I'll go ahead and let you know.",
	"729713": "I've already sent you a message.",
	"729714": "(Juan Marcus, aka Hound 07. The most basic lightning implant recipient, capable of typing at an incredible speed, almost like lightning).",
	"729715": "Let's contact everyone as soon as possible.",
	"729717": "He told the hunters near the window to head for the conference room.",
	"729718": "............ Okay.",
	"729719": "Next up are the children in the living quarters.",
	"729720": "Let's go to .......",
	"729722": "We came to the living quarters.",
	"729723": "There are hounds 09 and 04.",
	"729724": "Dad, my sister Arashine and I have updated all the equipment of the hound platoon. All metal materials have been treated to make them resistant, and important parts have been replaced with synthetic ones. I am exhausted.",
	"729725": "Because you have to be that thorough in your preparation if you want to compete with the cold-iron class of recipients. Now go to the conference room and assemble.",
	"729726": "Well, Arashine is worried about your father all the time. She hasn't said it out loud, but I think she's already read all about the situation of this operation.",
	"729727": "Oh well, I'll give credit where credit is due later.",
	"729728": "Please don't tell me I said that. Hmph.",
	"729729": "(Christine, aka Hound 09. She is the recipient of a heavily implanted transplant. For some reason, she always praises Hound 02 in front of me. She is in charge of equipment maintenance.)",
	"729730": "Ahehe ...... cute ...... Oh, Dad! I didn't see anything!",
	"729731": "Hound04, meet in the conference room. Well, at your age, I wouldn't be surprised if you have some idol stuff.",
	"729732": "Well, do you think so? Am I weird? Did your dad have one when he was younger?",
	"729733": "Ohon...... now let's just get together.",
	"729734": "I'm a bit of a weird girl after all......Dad, don't say a word to make me feel better......Shiksik......",
	"729735": "(Lilith Velarta, aka Hound Dog 04. She's a water transplant recipient and an idol geek.)",
	"729736": "Let's contact everyone as soon as possible.",
	"729738": "He told the hunters in the living quarters to head for the conference room.",
	"729739": "............ Okay.",
	"729740": "The rest are the two in the shooting room.",
	"729741": "Let's go to .......",
	"729743": "We came to the shooting room.",
	"729744": "There are hounds 06 and 08.",
	"729745": "You were lucky to survive today .......",
	"729746": "Hound 06, meet in the conference room.",
	"729747": "Dad, I'm feeling kind of gloomy today, are you okay?",
	"729748": "Yes, I will give this four-leaf clover to my father. This will share the luck I have with my father.",
	"729749": "(Hound 06, or Jun. He is the recipient of a blood stigmata transplant that is still in the testing phase. His nickname is Lucky Boy.)",
	"729750": "Battleship Formidable and Lutheriable...... That's an Atlas with three disintegrating reactors, right? Cool!",
	"729751": "Hound 08, meet in the conference room.",
	"729752": "Yes, I got it. This time, they even brought out the <color=#DC143CFF>Seat of the Mountain</color>. The one with the reactor replaced with a Type 37 Disintegrator Reactor. I believe the captain is Colonel Eismoll.",
	"729753": "I seem to recall that ship sitting in the docks for years.",
	"729754": "You don't see any active warships at all. They're all antiques. ...... I've seen enough Moonlight Thrones to be bored.",
	"729755": "(Lido Fast, aka Hound 08. Recipient of the most basic lightning implant, and the most knowledgeable person in the platoon about vehicles.)",
	"729756": "Let's contact everyone as soon as possible.",
	"729758": "He told the hunters who were near the shooting room to head for the conference room.",
	"729759": "............ Everyone's here.",
	"729760": "Let's go to the conference room and start the operational briefing.",
	"729761": "Captain.",
	"729762": "Hound 02, we have arrived at Changkuu City. We will soon start the operation for the sacred monument, so as soon as everyone is together, I will brief you on the precautions to take.",
	"729763": "Ha!",
	"729764": "As in the past, you will be given the task of squad leader. You will be in charge of the squadron as before, and you will be in charge of the strike force.",
	"729765": "This time, the enemy is a legendary figure. He is the owner of the metal stigmata known by the code name \"Cold Iron\". If ...... I am killed in action, you will be the next hound platoon commander.",
	"729766": "I am not good at taking care of children, so you will have to do those complicated things yourself, Captain.",
	"729767": "(Kambara Arashine, aka Hound Dog 02. He is the recipient of the Wind Stigmata implant and is the second-in-command with outstanding abilities.)",
	"729768": "(Lately, he seems to be cold towards me. (Lately, he seems to be cold toward me. He has started to distance himself from me, and he doesn't even call me father anymore. Is he rebellious?)",
	"729769": "You are a child, aren't you?",
	"729770": "I am already 18.",
	"729771": "You look grumpy today, have I done something to offend you?",
	"729772": "Ah, yes.",
	"729773": "I took out a necklace. A silver necklace with emeralds.",
	"729774": "I've been so busy chasing cold steel all this time that I haven't been able to give you a present. Happy birthday.",
	"729775": "I hope this puts him in a better mood a little.",
	"729776": "Wow me--I'm such a crude and ordinary person. ...... I think I'm too good for this kind of gift!",
	"729777": "Vice captain, you don't have to slouch over this one. How do you like it?",
	"729778": "She suddenly reached out and picked up the necklace, taking it halfway.",
	"729779": "I always thought the Captain had bad taste, but this time it's such a good one, how did you pick it?",
	"729780": "Oh, this is ......",
	"729781": "When I remembered the purchase, I thought of that little girl in my mind.",
	"729783": "Not at all, I was not like this before. Until I had to carry out orders from the top. But ...... I have never been ordered to kill a child before.",
	"729784": "How could such a child do that? How can he kneel down and meekly wait for death without crying, even though he is being held at gunpoint?",
	"729785": "Is it normal to have a child like that?",
	"729786": "I will now probably have to kill that boy again.",
	"729788": "I had a strange feeling. It was as if there was a seed in my heart. But until it blooms, there is no way to know what kind of seed it is.",
	"729789": "Wow ...... did a woman I don't know choose it for me!",
	"729790": "Sorry about ....... I don't want to say who that person is.",
	"729792": "............ Captain, you look terrible.",
	"729793": "I'm sorry.",
	"729794": "In cohon...... instead of that, Capt. That ...... I am already 18 years old.",
	"729795": "That's ......, so ......, can you please call me by my real name from now on?",
	"729796": "Her real name? I thought she liked to call each other in generational order.",
	"729797": "But oh well, that's okay. Codenames are for the military. Children should essentially call each other by their first names, and we can get used to doing so in the post-war world now.",
	"729798": "Okay, I got it. Storm sound.",
	"729799": "In the storm ...... to ...... needle and tiger ...... needle and tiger Capt.",
	"729800": "Yes, yes.",
	"729801": "I said, \"Wow, wait a minute ------!\"",
	"729803": "My dad told us to get together for a meeting, right? But hound09, why are you blocking my way in?",
	"729804": "The boy and girl hunters entered the conference room.",
	"729805": "Dad and Hound02, you're already in the conference room.",
	"729806": "Martin, is everyone here yet?",
	"729807": "What? Dad, why are you calling me by my name all of a sudden?",
	"729808": "The defeat of the First Legion is almost over and you guys will be going back to school shortly. You should get a little used to people calling you by name now.",
	"729809": "I will call you by name when I call you in the future so that you can get used to it beforehand. I just received some advice from Vice Captain Arashion.",
	"729810": "Captain ...... is right.",
	"729811": "Anyway, everyone line up. I will share the information with you.",
	"729813": "He briefed everyone on the mission that General Karos had told him about.",
	"729814": "Why don't you let us go on the mission?",
	"729815": "I don't care about that. Besides, I don't want to go head-to-head with an enemy of this level. Being on a battleship is not a bad idea.",
	"729816": "But, but. What am I supposed to do to find out information about the sacred monument?",
	"729817": "\"Are these battleships just to add to the atmosphere?\" Why would a local division participate?\"",
	"729818": "blah blah blah I'm ...... and 07 shut up. Shut up, 07. 07, you can talk in the chat room.",
	"729820": "I get it. I understand what everyone is saying.",
	"729821": "(I see there is still some pushback on the content of this operation.)",
	"729822": "My guess is that for some reason, General Karos was in a situation where he had to go down to the local forces, and this is the kind of mission he has come up with.",
	"729823": "When an order is given by a superior officer, it is the duty of a soldier to carry it out to perfection. No matter what the background of the assignment.",
	"729824": "That superior officer, when the cold iron was still weak, you abnormally refused to go after it even though my father had gone to the trouble of proposing to go after it, didn't you?",
	"729825": "And now that we are in a situation where we probably can't win and shouldn't go after them, what is it that is forcing us to participate?",
	"729826": "............ I know, I know. I'm so sorry I couldn't bring out a better operating environment for everyone.",
	"729827": "...... pff.",
	"729828": "That's why I say Dad is too serious.",
	"729829": "They work with a serious face and apologize with a serious face. It's like saying that this world is normal.",
	"729830": "I'm gonna go.",
	"729831": "I don't care ...... about those details. As long as I can stay close to the Captain, I am happy.",
	"729832": "Ah! I meant to say with everyone: ......",
	"729833": "The children nodded. The children looked at me with smiles on their faces, as if they silently agreed with the vice captain's statement.",
	"729834": "Everyone ......",
	"729835": "Okay, I get it. Let's get back to the main topic.",
	"729836": "That's right. We just need to focus on our mission and not overthink it.",
	"729837": "Hound 10, sum up the questionable behavior of the cold steel.",
	"729838": "Dad, Hound 10 is dead.",
	"729839": "Oh, I'm sorry. I've been having her play the role of general counsel all this time, so I just couldn't help it.",
	"729840": "I do.",
	"729841": "First, we know that the cold iron and light stigmata users use the intranet of the corps to frequently search for information on the city of Changkuo.",
	"729842": "What the hell are these guys doing so much research? They're going through it over and over, even cross-checking it.",
	"729843": "What I'm interested in is what the cold iron will try to come to Changkuu City on.",
	"729844": "This is another clue. So far, none of the local militaries have been able to find any traces of the cold iron heading toward Changku City. Although the iron raiders are attacking military bases here and there, they are gradually moving in the opposite direction, away from Changku City and toward the military garrisons in the east.",
	"729845": "Captain, is it just a bluff that Cold Iron seems to be interested in Changku City? Is her real target the Eastern Army?",
	"729846": "It is hard to believe that she would go toward the Eastern Legion because the implanted body of the cold iron stigmata contains data that would allow the Eastern Legion to estimate her location.",
	"729847": "What about the possibility of aligning yourself with the Eastern Legion?",
	"729848": "...... cold iron surrender to the Eastern Legion?",
	"729849": "I am not a hound10 so I am not sure, but perhaps the Eastern Army, which had nothing good to offer in the civil war, may need something that can be used as a trump card or for foreign propaganda. In that case, while Cold Iron may not be the best option, isn't she the only one who is still alive and could be used?",
	"729850": "I closed my eyes and thought about the behavioral patterns of the teacher who once taught me skills for a year. What kind of person was she?",

	"729852": "Dr. ...... Kantetsu was a man of constant action, even though his talents were quite ordinary.",
	"729853": "She always keeps moving forward. Yes, like a shot arrow, she never looks back. I don't know what the end point is that she is aiming for, but she never stops until she gets there.",
	"729854": "Such a person, once he or she thinks he or she is a member of the First Corps, would never try to huddle with other forces.",
	"729855": "If I did that, I would not be able to accept myself.",
	"729856": "But from the angle of those being pursued, wouldn't they think of looking for ...... escape routes to get away from our military pursuit?",
	"729857": "Surely ...... no, no. She surely doesn't consider herself prey to be chased.",
	"729858": "You must think you are the hunter of the prey.",
	"729859": "She is proactive ...... but how would she convert from a passive state to one where she is proactive ......?",
	"729860": "Are there enough critical elements in Changku City to convert it from a passive state to a proactive state? No, it is not limited to Chang Ku Shi. What cards does she still have left to play? An implanted body of stigmata? A light sacramental user? Or is there a traitor lurking in response within the southern army?",
	"729861": "Father!",
	"729862": "Wait a minute. I'll figure it out ...... if I think about it some more.",
	"729863": "Hey, hey! Look out there--!",
	"729867": "I turned around and looked at the window. Outside the window was a blue sky and a battleship was floating in the sky.",
	"729868": "That biggest one is the Mountain Seat, right? Contact the cockpit. Why are we moving closer to the Mountain Zodiac? Ah, ......!",
	"729869": "At that moment, everything became clear. The clues that had been disparate until that moment were connected as one at that moment.",
	"729870": "This boat is not approaching the mountain.",
	"729871": "They are approaching us from the mountains.",
	"729872": "Everyone--children--run ---- ----!",
	"729875": "You really are an introvert, aren't you? I can't believe you would just look down and shut up after a few words.",
	"729876": "That's enough. What do you want to eat tonight? I have money, doctor. I'll take you to a restaurant outside.",
	"729877": "Teacher ......",
	"729878": "I'll reconsider the final exam you just gave me. That's fine, right? Let's go.",
	"729879": "Can I ask a question?",
	"729880": "What?",
	"729882": "A teacher who loves cats and won't kill them: ......",
	"729905": "It's done. Communication module cloaking complete. Are you ready?",
	"729906": "We have been waiting.",
	"729907": "Morning of the 41st day of the trip.",
	"729908": "--Alarm, alarm, unidentified person detected in E3 block. Please identify yourself immediately. Failure to do so will result in attack.] --",
	"729909": "It doesn't matter. Just shoot. Put on some music. Dance with me.",
	"729910": "If only I had detected it earlier ...... earlier ......",
	"729911": "Here, open your mouth.",
	"729912": "Ugh. ......!",
	"729913": "Now you have enough metal in your body to build a model. Tell me the activation key to the smart core in the constellation of the Mountain. If you want to go to the other side without suffering.",
	"729914": "QVZ3-081B......3VD5-KV3T.",
	"729915": "I miss it. The last time I flew this thing was 30 years ago.",
	"729916": "Smart Core, check the communication module. I've repaired it. Popo?",
	"729917": "--[Communication module, starting up.] --",
	"729918": "Speak at least two more words.",
	"729919": "You ...... are a bunch of pussies. ......",
	"729920": "Voice sampling complete. Now you can imitate Colonel Eismoll's voice.",
	"729921": "Smart Core, install the plug-in you just connected. And contact the captain of the battleship Garuda.",
	"729922": "--[Waiting for permission to communicate from the other party. ...... connected.] --",
	"729923": "Dear Dustin, this is Colonel Eismoll. Good afternoon.",
	"729924": "-- [Hello, Colonel. Did you get any leads on the cold iron?] --",
	"729925": "No, sir. By the way, I just received a report from the adjutant. During a routine fire inspection, four soldiers were found to have lied about their identities, and when questioned, they confessed that they were working under orders from Dustin.",
	"729926": "--I'm sorry, I didn't know you were a - [what? That ...... is a fabrication made up to smear my name. Colonel Eismoll, I'm sure this is all a plot by that Lancaster fellow to divide our alliance ......]--",
	"729927": "One moment, please. What, Caspere! There's a battle on the bridge! Dustin, you're a multiple-layered trap ......!",
	"729928": "Beep!",
	"729929": "Okay, call terminated. Smart Core, now - rush in and hit the Battleship Realize.",
	"729930": "-- [Warning. This order violates the following Charter of Mankind No. ......]--",
	"729931": "I know. Run it by the captain's authority.",
	"729932": "-- [Understood. Creating flight route. Creation completed. Disintegrator power increasing 40%, 50%, 60% ......]--",
	"729933": "You ...... are crazy. What do you want?",
	"729934": "Just a little prank. You ask a lot of questions. You've got secret commands planted deep within the smart core. So that you can bypass the Human Charter. What are you doing with it? It's not for civil war, is it?",
	"729935": "Popo, we're about to collide. Please be on the lookout. Because the constellation of the mountain is so ridiculously big, you'll have to concentrate all your attention to maneuver the descending trajectory after the collision.",
	"729936": "We'll ride the mountain to Changkuu City.",
	"729937": "Dooon ............",
	"729938": "Whew - you landed safely. Is Popo okay too?",
	"729939": "I see, so it's different from landing. You used the repulsive force of the metal to float from inside the battleship. And you used the battleship to successfully hide what we were doing. ......",
	"729940": "I'm a smart guy. I'm glad to hear Popo is okay. What are they talking about on the radio?",
	"729941": "The southern army is in a big fight. As you predicted, the people who participated in the Holy Monument operation are more interested in the secret of the Eternal Anchor in Changku City than in capturing you.",
	"729942": "They seem to be extremely wary of each other more than they are of us.",
	"729943": "But that performance won't fool you for very long. The commanders under the general's command are not that stupid.",
	"729944": "Yeah, it's going to be tough going forward.",
	"729945": "Yeah, ......I tried to land as close to the Eternal Anchor as possible, but it looks like it's ......3 times farther away than I planned. ......",
	"729946": "From now on, we can't cheat anymore, we have to break through on our own merit. Let's go!",
	"729947": "Yes.",
	"729948": "Cold Steel, is this the last battle?",
	"729949": "...... haha, who knows about that!",
	"729951": "What was that thing you just saw?",
	"729952": "Looks like Lutherieble has launched an artificial rainfall projectile. Yeah ...... could certainly be an effective move.",
	"729953": "Apparently, you've been noticed.",
	"729954": "Artificial rain bombs? Why would you make such a thing?",
	"729955": "The low cost is to make sure you can't use your powers. If it rains, even soldiers without special equipment will be able to catch you in the act of disappearing.",
	"729956": "Yeah ...... I certainly haven't thought about how to deal with those situations.",
	"729957": "You have a lot of time to think about the future. ...... Phew, let's move on.",
	"729958": "Did you get hurt?",
	"729959": "It's just a scratch.",
	"729960": "Gentlemen! We are the last line of defense, and we must hold it. If we hold our ground here, I am sure that our friends' local divisions will come to our aid!",
	"729961": "This number ...... gosh, it's still formidable.",
	"729962": "How about once you retreat to ......?",
	"729963": "There's no time and no place to retreat ...... but I, for one, have decided that I'm not going to seek retreat anymore. I've come this far, and now it's time to move on!",
	"729964": "Oh ...... yeah! I'll do my best to support you too. Cold Steel, you must definitely reach that place! Together - let's go to that place together!",
	"729965": "........................Oh... ...done?",
	"729966": "............ not yet, cold iron.",
	"729967": "Let's hurry. We have to get there before the paratroopers that the local division might send. Isn't that what you said?",
	"729968": "Let's go. The monument will be here soon.",
	"729970": "I agree. Let's hurry. We're almost there.",
	"729971": "Cold iron!",
	"729972": "...... okay.",
	"729973": "Haha, the guys I just fought were so savage and boring, it kind of made me yawn ......",
	"729974": "We're getting close. Let's go.",
	"729975": "I think there's ...... someone up ahead: ......",
	"729976": "........................ because I can still fight.",
	"729977": "Oh, you're not the captain of the hunters.",
	"729978": "You southern regional warlords are so petty ...... hat ....... I'm not sure why they didn't give us a division commander.",
	"729979": "........................ You're not good enough to be the end point of my journey.",
	"729980": "............ cold-iron-dr.......",
	"729981": "It has been a while.",
	"729984": "The man was silent. The cold iron is also silent.",
	"729985": "It is still raining in Changkuu City.",
	"729986": "Teacher.",
	"729987": "The man looked up.",
	"729988": "My cat died.",
	"729989": "1 hour ago. Opposite side of Changkuu City.",
	"729991": "Uu............",
	"729992": "What was there ......?",
	"729993": "Oh ...... that's right.",
	"729994": "The bridge of the battleship Realize took a direct hit on the seat of the ...... mountain.",
	"729995": "...... then what happened?",
	"729996": "\"Grab my hand--\"",
	"729997": "I won't let you die--\"",
	"729998": "So ...... Realize crashed. Before it crashed, there was a hole in the window of the ...... conference room.",
	"729999": "From there ...... I was thrown out.",
	"730000": "Heaven and earth have switched places many times.",
	"730001": "The pieces of metal fell apart between heaven and earth, and I fell too.",
	"730003": "But then someone grabbed my hand.",
	"730005": "Hound 02!",
	"730007": "The Captain is a ...... moron.\"",
	"730008": "............a......aahhhh......... .........",
	"730009": "The girl named Arashine Kambara, who controls Hound 02 and Wind Stigmata body implants, was not a girl who liked to be pampered.",
	"730010": "She was always cold and fair, keeping some distance from people.",
	"730011": "Her hands clasped mine tightly against each other as she leaned against me from the underside.",
	"730012": "It was as if he didn't want to get up in bed in the morning. ......",
	"730013": "-- if you didn't hear the sound of her advancing bones shattering.",
	"730014": "Hound 02!",
	"730015": "I told you, ...... call me by my name. ...... Please keep your promise.",
	"730016": "LUTHERABLE! Atlas! Special Forces Command! Listen up, anybody! This is Hound Platoon! We urgently need medical assistance!",
	"730017": "I'm sorry ...... my ability to offset only the impact of the ...... Captain was not yet good enough ...... Gosh... ...",
	"730018": "Rest easy, Hound 02. deputy commander--Storm Sound ...... Why isn't anyone answering me on the radio! I thought we were buddies! Battleship Formidable! Battleship Eir!",
	"730019": "Captain ....... I think we are dancing at a graduation dance party right now.",
	"730020": "Her pupils were beginning to dilate.",
	"730021": "Don't talk anymore. ...... Don't die. That's an order. You can't die here. If you want to dance, go to school. The war is over. Put on your dancing skirts and let's go to graduation. It's like that old movie scene you see all the time.",
	"730022": "Like the old ...... movies?",
	"730023": "Yes, ...... just like the old movies. I'll dance with you to any number of songs--",
	"730024": "......I promise. ......Yes, ......Captain.",
	"730025": "I've already--",
	"730026": "She suddenly raised her upper body as if she was not injured at all and whispered in my ear.",
	"730027": "I think I've grown a little fond of you.",
	"730028": "She said this in a small voice, like a little bird chirping, and then she died.",

	"730059": "You have to understand my position in the center. The situation has changed drastically. An emergency meeting was just held at the Central Expeditionary Command of the Southern Legion.",
	"730060": "It was there that the three SS men in whom the General had the most confidence opened the War Arbitration Committee and revealed the secret of the Holy Monument--the secret of the Holy Monument.",
	"730062": "I had no idea that the eternal anchor was something like that. That was not something that beings like us were allowed to touch. Listen to me, you must retreat at once!",
	"730063": "You are to withdraw unconditionally. No attacks of any kind are allowed. Any action will be seen as a sign of the central army's intentions. Withdraw immediately! Withdrawal withdrawal withdrawal!",
	"730064": "...... Is that what you meant?",

	"730200": "Cold Steel smiled like a child at the end, made a peace, and left this world.",
	"730201": "At that moment ...... I felt as if some kind of power that words cannot explain left Cold Iron's body.",
	"730202": "The person held her as the cold iron fell forward and slowly laid her down on the ground.",
	"730203": "........................ if you are that... ...",
	"730204": "The person came toward me.",
	"730205": "Rajah...... unidentified person there should also surrender immediately. We are a joint force of the Southern Army's Operation Sacred Monument. If you do not comply, we will shoot you dead.",
	"730206": "Ummm......... you don't know me.",
	"730207": "Is that too much to ask? I've been out of the office for a while. I'll have to say a new entrance line.",
	"730208": "Please take your cold steel and leave this place. I'm sure you can--",
	"730209": "First, we go up.",
	"730211": "The person said this without regard to his surroundings and pointed to the sky.",
	"730212": "Then, then, you'll see ......",
	"730213": "...... What can I say?",
	"730214": "If you go to .................., you will see ......",
	"730215": "Then the lighter objects rose upward against gravity.",
	"730216": "The rain that had been falling in Long Sky City stopped falling as soon as she gave the order and slowly rose as if it was stationary in the air.",
	"730217": "What the hell is this? What kind of ...... thing is this? Ohhhhhh --------",
	"730218": "Bullets rose, tanks rose, and even the tears I shed flew upward.",
	"730219": "And thus.",
	"730220": "Then she turned her wrist and pointed downward.",
	"730221": "Then the heavier objects started falling down.",
	"730222": "-- [This is battleship Lutheran Lutheran Livre, requesting rescue, Lutheran Livre requesting rescue -- the disintegrator reactor is working fine, but for some reason the lift is not working!] -- [Battleship Lutheran Limburg",
	"730223": "-- [Atlas to the rescue. Legionaries, are we not brethren as brothers ......]--",
	"730224": "-- [Attention all personnel of the battleship Satyawati. Prepare for an emergency landing ...... we absolutely ...... absolutely ...... don't want to ...... ahhh! Aaahhhh!!!!!!!] --",
	"730225": "Hmmm... ...... I should stop overdoing it. Stop.",
	"730226": "And she brought it all to a halt.",
	"730227": "Let's go. Let them understand the situation for themselves.",
	"730228": "She said this and walked toward the sacred monument.",
	"730234": "Behind the holy monument, or rather where the holy monument brought me to a pleasant place where the sun shone, there was a ruin.",
	"730235": "She went further.",
	"730236": "You still have something to say, don't you?",
	"730238": "I have to ask, are you the savior?",
	"730239": "If you call someone who has saved the world a savior, then I am certainly a savior.",
	"730240": "So, can we ask you to save this world again?",
	"730241": "This ...... always someone shedding tears, imperfect world.",
	"730243": "I don't know, I don't know.",
	"730244": "I can reverse the rain that has fallen, but I cannot restore the tears that have flowed to the state they were in before they were shed. I have no control over the blood and tears that have already been shed.",
	"730245": "So what do you plan to do in the future?",
	"730246": "I agree. .................. I guess education is the first step.",
	"730247": "Education?",
	"730248": "We want those whose true hearts have been buried to realize their true selves, and we want those who have shed tears to become stronger. We want the blood that has been shed to not be in vain, and we want those who have been twisted by these times to have hope again.",
	"730249": "That's why I'm going to open a school.",
	"730250": "School?",
	"730251": "Yes, a school. I already have a tentative name in mind. People think it's not a very good name, but I couldn't think of anything else.",
	"730252": "It may be possible that the temporary name will eventually become the official name.",
	"730253": "She smiled childishly when she said this. Seeing this, I was momentarily reminded of the cold iron. I was about to say something, but then I came back to myself and felt sad.",
	"730254": "So, can I enroll?",
	"730255": "I'm still ...... not quite sure what kind of person I want to be. But I want to do my best to become someone I haven't seen yet.",
	"730257": "Oh, am I being rude by saying this so abruptly? Is there an entrance exam? I am confident about my grades in the humanities. Or is there some other requirement?",
	"730258": "I don't think so. I just thought it was a little surprising. Yeah, now that we have students, we should definitely establish a school.",
	"730259": "But there are things that we have to carry ourselves at this school, and if we enroll there, we may start another dangerous journey, but is it okay?",
	"730260": "What is the name of the school?",
	"730261": "Honkai Academy.",
	"730262": "Again, it's just a temporary name.",
	"730263": "I understand.",
	"730265": "I, Paris Parad, would like to apply for admission to Collapse Academy.",
	"730269": "Thus begins the adventure that begins with a raging fire and ends with a torrential downpour: ......",
	"730270": "The end was reached.",
	"730271": "Cold Steel, we've made it.",
	"730272": "OH ...... oe oe oe oe oe oe ......!",
	"730273": "What are you doing? How can you suddenly start vomiting at dinner time?",
	"730274": "Night of the 18th day of the trip.",
	"730275": "Huh - I told you I have something for you, didn't I?",
	"730276": "What do you want to give me, vomit?",
	"730277": "I don't have such a terrible personality. This is it.",
	"730278": "USB memory stick?",
	"730279": "I think I told you what each of these three USB drives are, remember?",
	"730280": "I know it's for a void printer system rewrite and various drawings of military equipment. I don't think you mentioned the other one.",
	"730281": "Yeah, I'll tell you what the third one is.",
	"730282": "This flash drive contains a variety of information that I have collected over the course of more than thirty years.",
	"730283": "Documents? What kind of material?",
	"730284": "Here's a document about the ...... heroes who were expelled.",
	"730285": "Huh, the Southerners don't seem to realize they're in the satellite picture, even though it's blurry. They're back.",
	"730286": "What do you mean? I don't know what I'm talking about.",
	"730287": "Anyway, I need you to give this material to someone on my behalf. That person should appear in front of the monument.",
	"730288": "Wait a minute cold iron. What about you? Aren't you going to Chang Kuai City?",
	"730289": "No one said anything about not going. I'm just worried that you're going to get killed on the way.",
	"730290": "No, people are motivated to survive because they have a goal to achieve.",
	"730291": "I know exactly what my goals are, how about you?",
	"730292": "Are you prepared for what you are going to do?",
	"730293": "I ...... am not as well thought of as a cold iron.",
	"730294": "You're going to die easily like that.",
	"730295": "Listen up. It is this very USB flash drive that is making me feel like I am going to survive.",
	"730296": "What? ......I can't believe I'm keeping something like that. ......",
	"730297": "You want to see how I end up, don't you?",
	"730298": "Someday you will find the value of your existence in this world.",
	"730299": "But first, I'm putting my dreams and beliefs in your hands. Don't lose them. And don't die on your own. If you lose it or die, all my plans will be lost.",
	"730300": "Do you understand? Put it away when you get it.",
	"730302": "I'll do my best. I'll do my best. But it's ...... a little weird to think of touching this directly with my hands.",
	"730303": "Hey, that's my belief, so don't talk like that. That's awesome!",
	"730304": "Yes, yes, yes. Then I'll wrap it in cloth.",
	"730305": "I kind of lost my appetite after doing this.",
	"730306": "It's true that ...... I lost my appetite when I threw up too.",
	"730307": "I kind of want to eat steak.",
	"730308": "I don't say those things.",
	"730309": "I wish I could eat hamburgers.",
	"730310": "Ugh ...... I'm drooling.",
	"730311": "I wish I could eat beef bowl.",
	"730312": "If you keep talking like that, I won't be able to swallow canned food!",
	"730313": "------Mo-- --",
	"730316": "Shh, popo. Using the power of invisibility. The sound I just heard, it sounded like the propulsion system of some strategic weapon.",
	"730317": "Yes.",
	"730319": "Did you see anything?",
	"730320": "I still can't see ....... Oh--!",
	"730321": "What?",
	"730322": "In the distance, I saw something shimmering like a star.",
	"730323": "Is that a sniper's sight?",
	"730324": "I'm not sure. Let's ambush them and surprise them in the opposite direction.",
	"730325": "Yeah.",
	"730326": "The light bounced around and came closer. And I could finally see what it was.",
	"730327": "Mou----~~",
	"730328": "........................ Huh, what the heck at all.",
	"730329": "If you're wondering what it is, it's not just a cow. It's got something wrapped around its horns that emits and reflects lasers.",
	"730330": "What's with the strategic weapons propulsion system. You should at least listen to that properly. ...... pfft.",
	"730331": "You didn't understand either, did you? You were scared to death. What a city girl.",
	"730332": "It's really rare to see wild cows around the city. ...... Or is it now the norm?",
	"730333": "Oh, by the way, I've been eating steak at Site-16 since ......",
	"730334": "It kind of made me want to ...... die a little bit less.",
	"730335": "But you were acting as if you were risking your life.",
	"730336": "But I thought it would be better to see your dream come true, so I decided against it.",
	"730337": "...... You really don't think life is important, do you?",
	"730338": "Then, well, you better remember the taste of that steak. Sad memories are more likely to stay with you than happy memories, so if you have a good time, you should cherish that memory. When you have a good time, you should cherish that memory, and when you think it's over, you should think back to it often. This is just my experience.",
	"730339": "It's like a candy that you keep in your pocket in case of emergency, right?",
	"730340": "Yes, like candy in your pocket.",
	"730341": "Mo~",
	"730342": "Hey hey hey, what should we do about this situation? Let's just go to ......",
	"730343": "I can't butcher a cow!",
	"730344": "I thought you were a legend! Liar!",
	"730345": "I'm not a legendary cook or anything. I used to be a city girl who believed that food would spring from the shelves.",
	"730346": "So what do you ...... do? This cow, it looks like only one. ...... No, one cow.",
	"730347": "Mou..................~",
	"730348": "No, look.",
	"730349": "Huh?",
	"730350": "The black clouds were driven away by the moonlight, and a gentle, cold light illuminated the land.",
	"730351": "I could faintly see the creature's muscles and horns moving in the grass on the outskirts of town.",
	"730352": "A herd of wild cattle.",
	"730353": "The cow that had appeared first turned around, perhaps startled to see us, and walked slowly toward the herd of cows.",
	"730354": "Then, with the light emanating from its horns, it disappeared into the waist-high grass.",
	"730355": "Cold iron.",
	"730356": "Hm?",
	"730357": "I've never seen any animals in my life, and then suddenly here I am, and I wonder if this has any special meaning.",
	"730358": "Don't panic, don't panic. You will have another chance. There will definitely be more chances to eat a lot of delicious food in the future. I'll be with you then.",
	"730359": "It's not like that. I was just wondering if maybe it was a good sign.",
	"730360": "A good sign?",
	"730361": "I certainly don't know what ...... this means yet, but I'm starting to think it's a good sign too.",
	"730362": "The moonlight gently illuminated the earth, and we lay down in the grass and talked endlessly.",
	"730363": "Thus the stars left me.",
	"730366": "In 2015 A.D., the universal enemy called the \"Supervisor of Will\" was defeated by mankind, and humanity was finally able to escape a fate dictated by disintegration.",
	"730367": "In 2017 A.D., the whole area coalition was interrupted for some reason, and several rebellions broke out within the Jinqiren.",
	"730368": "In 2022 A.D., a civil war broke out in the Jinqiren called the Aftermath War, in which 140 million people lost their lives and 260 million were injured. The First Corps then put an end to the rule of the Jinki-ren.",
	"730369": "The year 2027 A.D., the decade of the Legion, saw the birth of the World Construction Corps. For the first time in Earth's history, humanity was united.",
	"730370": "In 2055 A.D., in the 38th year of the Legion, a civil war in the Legion begins, triggered by the uprising of Charisma Sunderland, former commander of the First Legion.",
	"730371": "Then came the arms race, and the Knights of the Stigmata, the Hunters of Disintegration, the Mobile Fortress, the more powerful Disintegrator Furnaces and Battleships, the \"anti-planetary decisive weapons\" entered the historical arena.",
	"730372": "The year is 2057 A.D., 40 years of the Legion. The First Legion uses its \"anti-planetary decisive weapon\" to create the Yucatan Big Dead Zone, as well as a large number of smaller dead zones. However, the First Legion is ultimately defeated and all of its top brass are executed for crimes against humanity.",
	"730373": "Although the legions' civil war, referred to by some as humanity's civil war, came to a temporary end with 300 million dead, 80 million missing, and 110 million injured, the contradictions continued to smolder.",
	"730374": "In the same year, \"Houraiji Kyuushou,\" a hero of the old world, alleviated the contradictions, established a new order, and opened an educational organization called Collapse Academy.",
	"730375": "These are already in the past.",
	"730376": "It is now 45 years of the Legion. It has already been three years since I, Paris Parad, left the academy.",
	"730377": "There is no perfect enemy for the world, and there is no absolutely righteous person to save the world.",
	"730378": "All that exists is a reality composed of countless bonds, in which people respect each other, fight each other, and kill each other.",
	"730379": "Time is still going on, and all the past that has passed is only a prelude. As I said at the very beginning, I am not the hero of the story that follows.",
	"730380": "Paris Parad is a watcher. She waits for the bell to ring and watches as the next group of students enroll.",
	"730381": "And now it's your turn.",
	"730382": "Tactical Sixth Grade students, would you like to know what kind of story you are going to develop?",
	"730834": "Hah ...... gehoo .......",
	"730836": "What the hell is going on? What the hell are these people?",
	"730839": "Oh, ...... ah!",
	"730840": "Don't come over here!",
	"730841": "--BANG BANG BANG BANG!",
	"730843": "Ki, it's not working!",
	"730846": "What the hell? What the hell is going on?",
	"730847": "Are these guys ...... zombies? I thought zombies were monsters and only in movies. ......",
	"730848": "Don't come over here!",
	"730849": "I was just passing through ...... just hunting in the snowy mountains .......",
	"730850": "Why do I have to go through this?",
	"730854": "Oh, .......",
	"730855": "It's not just zombies ......--",
	"730860": "There is a terrible calamity happening in this world.",
	"730861": "The principles are unknown, but what it causes are natural disasters, animal mutations, and the emergence of zombie-like corpses and monsters. ......",
	"730862": "And for a calamity that could not be fundamentally resolved, the upper echelons had no choice but to suppress information and fight it in the shadows. Therefore, to the eyes of the general public, it appeared as if various \"unexpected accidents\" were occurring in the world.",
	"730863": "But those who know the truth call it--",
	"730864": "<color=#FF0000FF>Honkai</color>.",
	"730865": "The world is still in its original order, but I wonder how many people ...... die every day without knowing anything about it.",
	"730866": "--Ha, it just makes my head hurt to think about it, and it's not very simple to do. We just need to defeat the collapse altogether--and we will.",
	"730867": "That's what I've been working so hard for all these years.",
	"730868": "Kiana, I'm off!",
	"730869": "Move, move, move~! I killed another one!",
	"730870": "Zombies are gathering. ...... This is certainly the area where the decay energy numbers are most disturbed. Looks like we found it.",
	"730871": "Report, this is Kiana, we found--",
	"730872": "Zaarzer. .......",
	"730873": "Hello, can you hear me? Hello, can you--",
	"730874": "Ki--ra--sis~.",
	"730875": "Oi~.",
	"730876": "Why is the signal so bad? Is this another effect of the collapse?",
	"730878": "Hmmm, it's just a zombie born from decay. It's a little too much for this Kiana.",
	"730879": "We're going to get it over with quickly!",
	"730880": "The ones that are not crunchy!",
	"730882": "This voice--",
	"730883": "Kukulkan! How is that guy still alive!",
	"730885": "He seems to be very weak. Now may be our chance to defeat him.",
	"730887": "No, wait!",
	"730888": "We won't let them get away!",
	"730890": "Aww!",
	"730891": "Oh, that's ......",
	"730894": "Kiana. .......",
	"730895": "Kiana, wake up quickly!",
	"730896": "Hmmm.",
	"730897": "You can find it here: .......",
	"730898": "If you sleep any longer you'll turn into a popsicle.",
	"730899": "Kira sister!",
	"730900": "Oh, yes. A communicator, a communicator - there it is.",
	"730901": "Did you bump your head? You seem kind of spaced out.",
	"730902": "That's not true!",
	"730903": "Ugh, my head hurts. ......",
	"730904": "By the looks of it, I don't think you're doing very well.",
	"730905": "Can you introduce yourself?",
	"730906": "Why don't you believe me: .......",
	"730907": "Kiana Kasrana, a member of the Valkyrie, a specialized anti-disintegration unit.",
	"730908": "B-grade.\"",
	"730909": "You don't need to emphasize that part!",
	"730910": "Yes, yes, yes. If you have the energy to talk back, you certainly seem to be doing okay.",
	"730911": "Ugh ...... tease .......",
	"730912": "This place looks like an ...... ice cave.",
	"730913": "Yes, I remember.",
	"730914": "I had detected an unstable decay energy reaction in the snowy mountains in this area last night.",
	"730915": "So, me and my teacher, Shigure Kira, were tasked to come and investigate--",
	"730916": "As we split up to search, I encountered a huge Honkai Beast and was swallowed by the avalanche it caused and fell to this point.",
	"730917": "It's ...... embarrassing for Kira's sister to know.",
	"730918": "Consider it a valuable experience.",
	"730919": "Let's meet up first. I'll send you my coordinates, can you come this way?",
	"730920": "You should send Kira's sister to the rescue!",
	"730921": "Yeah? You seem fine and can walk back on your own, right?",
	"730922": "I understand ....... And I know that Kira's sister has a lot of work to do at the temporary command headquarters.",
	"730923": "That guy is still alive, so do whatever you can to find a place for him.",
	"730924": "Of course.",
	"730925": "But keep the communication alive. I'll share specifics of the situation when we meet up.",
	"730926": "Copy.",
	"730927": "Huh, the weapon I brought to ...... has been sent somewhere too.",
	"730928": "But all this wouldn't be a problem.",
	"730929": "In hand were several simple guns that had been washed into the cave by the avalanche.",
	"730931": "I wonder if this belongs to someone who died because of the ...... collapse.",
	"730932": "Damn, we need to get out of here.",
	"730933": "I saw a way out!",
	"730934": "I wonder if the collapse energy created by the explosion of the collapse is also weakening.",
	"730935": "There weren't that many zombies that we encountered along the way.",
	"730936": "He's at .......",
	"730937": "Where the hell is that Honkai Beast that Kira and I couldn't finish off before?",
	"730938": "If I had headed into town--",
	"730940": "Nah, then you can't be unaware of it. It's not too late, we have to hurry!",
	"730941": "The confluence should not be far away.",
	"730942": "Zaarzer. .......",
	"730945": "It was close!",
	"730946": "Why are there suddenly so many zombies out there!",
	"730947": "The signal has also become unstable. ...... I see.",
	"730948": "That guy is still in the snowy mountains.",
	"730949": "But such a makeshift weapon is useless against such a large number of people!",
	"730951": "If not, I'll fight with my fists and my spirit! I'm not afraid of anything. Come at me!",
	"730952": "Kuh!",
	"730953": "It's done. ......, right?",
	"730955": "You're still here!",
	"730956": "Musical note spell sword!",
	"730959": "Kiana, are you okay?",
	"730960": "Huh, it's okay. Kira sister, how did you find me?",
	"730961": "The temporary command center is just around the corner. How could they not hear us if we make such a big fuss?",
	"730962": "What's wrong with you? You acted on your own when you encountered Kukulcan.",
	"730963": "Don't be naughty. I'm going to be an S-class Valkyrie someday. If I can't even get a foot in the door against these guys...",
	"730964": "You're going to die here?",
	"730965": "Eh.",
	"730966": "If you fail to finish him off, and he is provoked to flee to a crowded place - I don't need to tell you what the consequences will be.",
	"730967": "Sorry, .......",
	"730968": "Huh.",
	"730969": "For now, go rest at the temporary command center. You can't fight any more in that condition.",
	"730970": "Okay. .......",
	"730971": "Kira, your sister is very demanding today.",
	"730972": "Phew.",
	"730973": "The sky looks the same as always. Whether it is an outbreak of collapse or a battle with a giant Honkai Beast, it seems like \"no big deal\".",
	"730974": "It's kind of weird to be able to lie on the front line and look at the sky.",
	"730975": "You don't want to keep fighting all the time.",
	"730976": "Kira sister?",
	"730977": "Have you been able to arrange a job at the command headquarters?",
	"730978": "Yes. Kiana's right, he's very weak.",
	"730979": "So that guy is also very unstable as a source of disintegration.",
	"730980": "So much so that sometimes the decay energy reaction disappears completely.",
	"730981": "I never thought that he was the cause of this collapse.",
	"730982": "I guess I'm still a work in progress.",
	"730983": "If we had completely defeated that guy a year and a half ago at that time, no one would have been killed. ......",
	"730984": "At the time, I thought I had that guy completely beat. So if it's responsibility, it's on me.",
	"730986": "But I had just become your teacher then, and that's how I ran into such a big guy. ......",
	"730987": "Honestly, I don't know if I'm lucky or unlucky either.",
	"730988": "You were excited. Like this time.",
	"730989": "Because I thought it was a chance to prove my ability.",
	"730990": "Totally. I'm talking about becoming an S-class Valkyrie in my sleep, remember?",
	"730991": "Is that really that important?",
	"730992": "Of course!",
	"730993": "Mom is an S-class Valkyrie.",
	"730994": "Of course I know. I'm part of Lady Cecilia's platoon, too.",
	"730995": "The S-class Valkyries are super strong, there's no way they can lose to collapse!",
	"730996": "It's the other way around, right? I'm getting stronger so I can be an S-class.",
	"730997": "You could say that.",
	"730998": "But I saw in the manual that even a Class B Valkyrie can jump over Class A and become Class S if there is a recommendation or selection by the captain, right?",
	"730999": "So S-class is just a name--",
	"731000": "No, it's not!",
	"731001": "If you become an S-class Valkyrie, you will be given more authority and can go to bigger battlefields.",
	"731002": "I don't know when it's going to be complete if we're just going to keep knocking down little Honkai Beasts forever.",
	"731003": "Many people still do not know of the existence of the collapse and how they themselves, and their families, were sacrificed .......",
	"731004": "I can't stand that kind of unfulfilling feeling.",
	"731006": "Is that why you want to be an S-class Valkyrie?",
	"731007": "Not at all. Just like your mother. Simple, but powerful.",
	"731008": "Maybe it's time for that to happen.",
	"731009": "What?",
	"731010": "I have to tell you something, Kiana.",
	"731011": "When this mission is over--",
	"731013": "Alarm!",
	"731014": "Captain Kira, a large number of disintegrating organisms have appeared around the command center and are attacking us!",
	"731015": "What about satellite images?",
	"731016": "We have not yet captured the decaying organisms.",
	"731017": "What is the measured value of the decay energy?",
	"731018": "It continues to rise straight up.",
	"731019": "At least that would indicate that Kukulcan is active again. The effect of this has been to awaken the disintegrating organisms.",
	"731020": "Kiana, let's talk about the rest later!",
	"731021": "I know that without being told!",
	"731022": "You have to defeat them first!",
	"731023": "Tsk, there are so many!",
	"731024": "We need to find it fast. ......",
	"731025": "Do not act rashly.",
	"731026": "But he's hiding in the snowy mountains, right? If he sneaks away, that's exactly the kind of trouble he'll get into!",
	"731027": "I know. So--",
	"731028": "Kira handed Kiana a gun.",
	"731029": "If communication is lost, use this to contact me.",
	"731030": "There are many Valkyries out there who are acting just as dispersed as you are. They are all thinking the same thing you are.",
	"731031": "But you are so simple, you don't know what you can do when you lose your temper.",
	"731032": "Ugh. .......",
	"731033": "Protect yourself first.",
	"731034": "Copy.",
	"731036": "Found!",
	"731037": "I knew it was taking advantage of the snowy mountain terrain to move forward while crawling. I really don't know what Honkai Beasts are thinking.",
	"731038": "Zaarzer. .......",
	"731039": "Anyway, I'm going to call Kira and her sisters first, and when they all arrive--",
	"731041": "No way, you noticed me! I didn't do anything!",
	"731042": "The Honkai Beast named Kukulkan leapt and floated in the air. It appears to be trying to walk away.",
	"731043": "But then, Kukulkan was staring at Kiana. It was as if Kiana had not found the Honkai Beast, but the Honkai Beast had found Kiana.",
	"731044": "I don't know what you're trying to do, but I'm not going to let you get away with it!",
	"731045": "If you fail to finish him off, and he is provoked to flee to a crowded place - I don't need to tell you what the consequences will be.",
	"731046": "These weapons remain here because of the sacrifice of their owners.",
	"731047": "Protect yourself first.",
	"731049": "I know, of course I know!",
	"731050": "But I'm sorry, Kira-sister. I'm disobeying your orders again.",
	"731051": "--Van!",
	"731052": "Warn!",
	"731053": "Kiana jumped off the snowy mountain, clung to Kukulkan's body as he tried to fly away, and began shooting at the giant body.",
	"731054": "Kukulkan struggled violently and swung Kiana to the ground.",
	"731055": "Ugh, ouch!",
	"731056": "But now I have your attention.",
	"731057": "If you run away, I will chase you and shoot you as many times as I have to. Until you fall to the ground!",
	"731058": "Unless you beat me, you'll never get away in one piece!",
	"731060": "Kiana fired a signal round into the sky and readied her weapon.",
	"731061": "Come. It's a duel!",
	"731062": "Oh, .......",
	"731063": "Did you win ......?",
	"731064": "-- Warn!",
	"731065": "You can still move!",
	"731066": "Kiana!",
	"731067": "With a voice, a note-spell sword pierced Kukulkan's body.",
	"731068": "Finished. .......",
	"731069": "I'm tired. Why didn't you come earlier?",
	"731070": "I ran as fast as I could.",
	"731071": "But thanks to you for keeping that guy around. You did good.",
	"731072": "It's a violation of the order, though.",
	"731073": "Wait! My whole body hurts and I'm exhausted. Don't get mad at me now!",
	"731074": "xoxo.",
	"731075": "Why are you angry?",
	"731076": "The only order is to let us know if you run into that guy. You did exactly that.",
	"731077": "After that, we just acted according to the situation.",
	"731078": "Because if we go any further, we will cross the ocean.",
	"731079": "Besides, there are still people living over there.",
	"731081": "Phew. Looks like I can rest easy.",
	"731082": "Why are you talking like you are retiring?",
	"731083": "I'm not that old yet!",
	"731084": "Oh, your father will tell you.",
	"731085": "What, my dad?",
	"731086": "Pipi. .......",
	"731087": "The communicator rang.",
	"731088": "Wow, they really contacted me.",
	"731089": "Kira reported the mission completed, so I'll give you the next assignment.",
	"731090": "Wait, Valkyrie is a black company? Give it a break.",
	"731091": "You're the one who said you wanted to be an S-class Valkyrie as soon as possible.",
	"731092": "Ugh. .......",
	"731093": "Just kidding. I've sent you the mission description, check back later.",
	"731094": "Okay. .......",
	"731095": "Is this person the target?",
	"731096": "Mission: go to Senba Academy and bring the target back to headquarters. Details: no reason or details can be given.",
	"731097": "Target's name: Houraiji Kyuushou.",
	"731098": "From the picture, he looks like a high school student about my age.",
	"731099": "Senba Academy ......?",
	"731100": "Aside from me, your sister Kira is not old enough to be a student anymore.",
	"731101": "I'm gonna hit you.",
	"731102": "But this time you have to go alone.",
	"731103": "What?",
	"731104": "I've been meaning to tell you for a while.",
	"731105": "If I do well on this assignment, I'll be on my own.",
	"731106": "From now on, I can handle my duties alone.",
	"731107": "I mean, that's--",
	"731108": "Yes.",
	"731109": "This is your first assignment--a one-man mission.",
	"731110": "Good luck with your goals, Kiana.",
	"731111": "I look forward to the day your dreams come true.",
	"731112": "A haze is gathering.",
	"731113": "Fog spreads.",
	"731114": "Cassandra came to the entrance of the passageway and stood there looking at the dark path inside.",
	"731115": "It's creepy to see ....... ......",
	"731116": "Once inside, you have no idea how much time you will waste. ......",
	"731117": "Anyway, I can't wait to get home, eat dinner, and sleep in a soft bed. ......",
	"731118": "Cassandra hesitated at the entrance to the passageway, wandering around and not wanting to go inside for any length of time.",
	"731120": "Oh well. If you don't go in, they will ask you after you return and you will have to come back here.",
	"731121": "I don't even have the confidence to hide something like this in front of my boss. ......",
	"731122": "After all, solve the problem at once, then go back and have a good night's sleep.",
	"731123": "Cassandra changed her mind.",
	"731124": "She slowly walked into the passageway.",
	"731125": "...... Oh?",
	"731126": "--is anyone talking to you?",
	"731127": "...... would be fine. If they ask you something, it's too much trouble to answer.",
	"731128": "Her figure disappeared before the entrance to the passage.",
	"731129": "Little by little, the fog entangled her, enveloping the passageway in front of her.",
	"731130": "But even so, the road stretching ahead is clearly visible.",
	"731131": "Who established this passageway here: .......",
	"731132": "What is the person's purpose? ......",
	"731133": "Let's go to ....... There is no point in thinking about anything else. You will find the answer sooner or later.",
	"731134": "Cassandra walked slowly, her hands on the walls of the aisle. Occasionally, she would pull a lollipop from her pocket to replenish her energy.",
	"731135": "After she finished three lollipops, the fog in front of her suddenly changed.",
	"731136": "At first, there were only ripples that seemed to spread across the surface of the water.",
	"731137": "However, it soon turned into a violent wave.",
	"731138": "In that wave of fog, Cassandra stared intently at what emerged there.",
	"731139": "...... This is .......",
	"731140": "It was a small box.",
	"731141": "It looked like a pencil box often used by children.",
	"731142": "But see .......",
	"731143": "Somehow I knew that that pencil box was not the place to put stationery.",
	"731144": "This ...... why does it feel strange .......",
	"731145": "I think I have seen something like this pencil box somewhere before.",
	"731146": "The next moment, the pencil box opened automatically as if a built-in mechanism had been triggered.",
	"731147": "The items inside were not things like pencils, compasses, or rulers, but .......",
	"731148": "...... Tarot cards?",
	"731149": "The top tarot card that appeared was the \"Hanged Man\" card.",
	"731150": "A strange voice rang in my ear.",
	"731151": "\"This is the first of the 'Tarot Card Serial Murder Cases' ...... a wealthy man from the city was found ...... hanging dead from a cherry tree in his backyard.... ...\"",
	"731152": "\"When ...... his body was found, this tarot card was inserted at his feet: ......\"",
	"731153": "According to ...... forensic examination, it appears that the deceased was strangled by pressure from an outside force and then hung from a tree by someone. This is a murder ...... and the tarot card at the foot of the tree is the very symbol that metaphorically represents murder .......\"",
	"731154": "\"There is one odd thing about ......, however--\"",
	"731155": "...... Why didn't the killer hang him upside down?\"",
	"731156": "The voice broke off abruptly there.",
	"731157": "The tarot card for \"The Hanged Man\" also completely vanished into the mist.",
	"731158": "The first silence returned in the aisle.",
	"731159": "......Well, that's okay. Let's keep going.",
	"731160": "The fog gradually thickened.",
	"731161": "The road is also somewhat steep.",
	"731162": "Still, it was not much of a walk.",
	"731163": "Cassandra was walking down the street thinking about many things. She was so distracted by what had just happened that she even forgot to take out her lollipop and replenish her energy.",
	"731164": "And at that moment, the fog in front of me changed again.",
	"731165": "This time, a notebook with a stained surface and faint traces of blood on some parts appeared.",
	"731166": "When Cassandra picked up the notebook, she heard a voice in her ear before she even opened the page.",
	"731167": "I know, I know. ...... I know! I'll write this mystery down here!\"",
	"731168": "Why is this 'Tarot Card Serial Murder' lacking a metaphor for the murders--?\"",
	"731169": "The victim corresponding to \"The Hanged Man\" was hung from a tree. The victim corresponding to \"The Tank\" was lying under a vehicle. The victim corresponding to \"The Fool\" was a bright man. ...... We tried to get to the heart of the matter and find the root cause of these inconsistencies. ...... But it may have been nothing more than self-reference by the killer! Maybe it wasn't!\"",
	"731170": "\"In every 'tarot card murder,' the picture of the tarot card was opposite to its victim--at the heart of it, the opposite tarot card! And of all the murders, only one tarot card did not appear until the very end: ...... it was the 'World' card.\"",
	"731171": "\"......Therefore, this must be the killer's motive! The person was trying to turn the world upside down through the opposite tarot card murders--\"",
	"731172": "\"...... and the image of the culprit was actually also self-evident in the self-reference of this Tarot card of opposites - the person was the image of the culprit that the public authorities and the people had in mind, i.e., everyone knew that the culprit was knew that they thought he was an adult, violent-looking man - so when he reversed it, ...... the culprit was actually .......\"",
	"731173": "His excited voice suddenly disappeared, along with the notebook in his hand.",
	"731174": "A strange sensation welled up in Cassandra's mind.",
	"731175": "That's odd. .......",
	"731176": "What are these tarot cards and what is that voice? ......",
	"731177": "Why does it feel nostalgic? ......",
	"731178": "Now that this has happened, we have to keep moving forward. ...... Huh, I'm really tired. ......",
	"731179": "Cassandra staggered forward and kept moving.",
	"731180": "Remembering the lollipop, she put it in her mouth again, but there were only a few lollipops left in her pocket. This made her very sad.",
	"731181": "Don't worry ...... you should reach the end of the line soon .......",
	"731182": "So she consoled herself. The soft beds and good food at home were Cassandra's greatest motivation to keep walking.",
	"731183": "...... Of course, there was also the curiosity to unravel the mystery.",
	"731184": "...... Oh?",
	"731185": "Cassandra stopped.",
	"731186": "Nothing to worry about. It was just that the fog in front of my eyes had changed again.",
	"731187": "This time, a hazy view emerged through the fog.",
	"731188": "On the main street, a girl in goth fashion is excitedly talking something to a man in a police uniform.",
	"731189": "This is the truth of what I deduced: ...... the killer must be someone with these characteristics, and I also predicted where he would commit his next crime: ......",
	"731190": "You said, \"...... hey, sweetie, isn't it time for school now? Why would you come here and explain such a thing ...... and a child like you get involved in a murder investigation. This is not a game. Now be a good girl and go home.\"",
	"731191": "\"...... No, no, ...... everything I'm saying is true! I told you that this is the truth of what I deduced! I drew my conclusions from the published tarot cards. Look--\"",
	"731193": "The screen changes, and the girl is hiding in a dark corner of the room, mumbling to herself and sounding grumpy.",
	"731194": "\"What a black magic obsessed freak, a self indulgent moron, and an ugly man who watches too much TV drama. ......\"",
	"731195": "Why don't you believe me? The bad guy is that murderer!\"",
	"731196": "No. ......\"",
	"731197": "You ...... are all evil!\"",
	"731198": "Just then, the girl's voice suddenly disappeared.",
	"731199": "She looked up, a sad expression on her face.",
	"731200": "The sound of knocking echoes incessantly through the space, but no one responds. And when the sound fades--",
	"731201": "An even darker shadow completely enveloped her.",
	"731202": "-- Oh, .......",
	"731203": "Cassandra watched expressionlessly as the scene disappeared with the fog.",
	"731204": "My heart is pounding and racing.",
	"731205": "A subtle feeling welled up in Cassandra's heart that she had never felt before.",
	"731207": "She had no choice but to wave. Cassandra felt that her body was becoming more and more fatigued. Moreover, the \"star spirit faith\" in her body was also sending unstable signals.",
	"731208": "...... Apparently, you can't get any better than this: .......",
	"731209": "Well, okay. This is all the information we need.",
	"731210": "-I still need to go back and report to the boss and share this information with you all.",
	"731211": "The entrance to the passage in front of you is covered with fog.",
	"731212": "Still, the road inside is faintly visible.",
	"731213": "Pajasso stood at the entrance to the passageway with his hand on his lower jaw, looking in.",
	"731214": "Hey, hey, is there someone inside? ♢",
	"731215": "If anyone is there, please respond.",
	"731216": "......If you don't respond, I'm going away ♡.",
	"731217": "The footsteps gradually move away.",
	"731218": "Pajasso's figure disappeared from in front of the passage entrance.",
	"731219": "For a while.",
	"731220": "For a while.",
	"731221": "She suddenly reappeared in front of the entrance again.",
	"731222": "I've been observing from the shadows for a while, but I don't see anyone or hear anything. ......♧",
	"731223": "Yeah, yeah, apparently there are definitely no other creatures inside, handsome.",
	"731224": "Pajasso nodded, a strange smile on his face.",
	"731225": "Okay, let's see what the view is like inside ...... ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡",
	"731226": "Her figure disappeared from in front of the entrance. It was as if she was shrouded in fog as she entered the passageway.",
	"731227": "Then, when she was fully inside, Pajasso turned abruptly.",
	"731228": "...... Oh my, who's talking? ♧",
	"731229": "All right. Maybe it's just my imagination, handsome.",
	"731230": "Pajasso made his way through the passageway as if he had been captured by fog.",
	"731231": "The ground was hard cobblestone and the walls were solid brick, but for some reason I felt as if I was walking through a quagmire.",
	"731232": "Ohohoho~♤",
	"731233": "Even under these bizarre circumstances, Pajasso was able to laugh, and moreover, the smile on his face became increasingly joyful.",
	"731234": "It's really interesting ...... I didn't know there was a place like this at the beginning. It's really unexpected. ugh♡♡♡",
	"731235": "As the smile on her face became even more joyful, the world I could see before me, and the fog that had spread over it, changed.",
	"731236": "The fog began to gather at a point in the air, as if sucked into a hole that appeared in the air.",
	"731237": "After a while.",
	"731238": "Pajasso stared at a point in the air. Then something like an outline appeared in it.",
	"731239": "...... Oh my? ♧",
	"731240": "- which she had not expected at all.",
	"731241": "...... PC.",
	"731242": "This is really ...... unexpected ♡",
	"731243": "The computer was an old-style integrated desktop, with no mouse and only a keyboard connected to the main unit.",
	"731244": "The two were floating in the air, as if waiting for someone to turn them on.",
	"731245": "Fufu ......♢",
	"731246": "Pajasso pressed the power button and the unlock screen appeared.",
	"731247": "Password is ......♧",
	"731248": "169515......\"",
	"731249": "As I unconsciously typed in the numbers, the computer screen immediately brightened.",
	"731250": "Unlocked.",
	"731251": "But at that moment, the computer itself disappeared completely, along with the keyboard. It was as if it had been carried away from the black hole by a large hand that suddenly appeared.",
	"731253": "Pajasso stood there, thinking. After a while, he began to move forward again.",
	"731254": "Part of that doubt was due to the sudden appearance and disappearance of the computer, but more than that, it came from myself.",
	"731255": "...... funny. ...... handsome",
	"731256": "......I can't believe I know that computer deactivation powered by ♤",
	"731257": "...... but ...... why--do I get the feeling that I'm not the original owner of that computer? ♡♡",
	"731258": "Pajasso continued to walk down the aisle.",
	"731259": "The earlier incident has made her joking smile somewhat more cautious and her eyes very keen as she observes her surroundings.",
	"731260": "However, we still did not hear any noise at all for a while.",
	"731261": "--except that the fog is getting thicker and thicker.",
	"731262": "And when Pajasso walked halfway through--",
	"731263": "......flu♧",
	"731264": "As if by surprise, but also within expectations, a ripple spread out from the fog in front of us.",
	"731265": "A familiar machine appeared among the ripples.",
	"731266": "It was the very same old computer that Pajasso had unlocked earlier.",
	"731267": "I wonder if it's some kind of DLC that they're coming out with ......2 times. ♢",
	"731268": "With a sarcastic smile, Pajasso came over to the computer and looked down. The display showed an outdated operating system and terminal screen, and it was doubtful that it would ever work properly. The desktop screen was almost empty, with only an icon that looked like a chat room.",
	"731269": "Pajasso suddenly furrowed his brow.",
	"731270": "She manipulated the computer cursor with her keyboard and opened that chat room.",
	"731271": "What was displayed there was a close communication between the owner of this computer terminal and a friend of another computer terminal.",
	"731272": "\"How about ...... now?\"",
	"731273": "I got out of there safely. I got out of there in one piece. Someone exchanged identities with me and dressed me in my own clothes: ......\"",
	"731274": "Good,\" he said, \"then I can continue to do the things I haven't completed! Then I can continue with what I haven't been able to complete: ......\"",
	"731275": "I've been thinking about it the whole time I've been locked in here.",
	"731276": "'Same for me. While I couldn't get in touch with you, I looked up information and kept writing ......\"",
	"731277": "Before I could finish reading the conversation, the same disappearance as before was reproduced. The chat room disappeared into the fog, along with the computer.",
	"731278": "Pajasso stood as if in thought and shook his head faintly.",
	"731279": "When I was reading this conversation......, surprisingly I didn't feel like I was seeing them for the first time. It's as if I was one of them before......♤",
	"731280": "Huh, that's really strange, handsome.",
	"731281": "Smiling again, Pajasso's gaze turned forward.",
	"731282": "I wonder if these scenes that appear and disappear are \"your\" way of deliberately trying to get me to move on? ♧",
	"731283": "If you want me to move forward so badly, I'll do what you want ......♡",
	"731284": "Visibility in the corridor became increasingly poor.",
	"731285": "As the fog thickened, the visibility gradually turned to pure white.",
	"731286": "And in the condensed fog, Pajasso was walking slowly.",
	"731287": "Today's events are getting weirder and weirder ...... and more and more interesting ♡",
	"731288": "The computer that suddenly appeared, the chat room conversation ......, who are those two people talking about at all? What do they have to do with this place of beginnings and our \"faith in star spirits\"?",
	"731289": "Just thinking about ...... brings up as many mysteries as a feast at a banquet ♤!",
	"731290": "As if in response to Pajasso's soliloquy, that computer reappeared from the fog.",
	"731291": "This time, Pajasso proceeded to the computer as he was accustomed to doing, only to find that the computer was turned off again.",
	"731292": "...... Oh my? ♢",
	"731293": "Pajasso pressed the power button without hesitation.",
	"731294": "However, what appeared on the display after pressing the power button was neither the chat room that appeared earlier nor that old operating system.",
	"731295": "It can be found at .......",
	"731297": "It can be found at .......",
	"731298": "...... It was a blueprint.",
	"731299": "...... This is .......",
	"731300": "The moment he saw the blueprints, a strange feeling welled up in Pajasso's head, so much so that he forgot to attach the suits he always uses to the words.",
	"731301": "--because the blueprints were both familiar and new to her. She felt like she had seen them before, but seeing them again made her mind go blank.",
	"731302": "Then the scene of a conversation with a stranger came to mind.",
	"731303": "\"......This completes the world we have created: ......\"",
	"731304": "\"I'm really looking forward to ......I bet it's going to be a very interesting world, isn't it?\"",

	"731306": "\"......f...... then you don't have to worry about the police or anything like that...... let's go on a rampage in that new world!\"",
	"731307": "\"...... Yes, I do. What kind of person do you want to be in that new world?\"",
	"731308": "You say, \"...... me? I like my personality the way it is now, so I don't need to change it. ...... But if possible, I'd prefer a role where I can do as I please, not be responsible and push the troublesome stuff to the more responsible **... ...Yeah, and what about you? What kind of person do you want to be?\"",
	"731309": "I want to be \"...... me? I want to be someone completely different from who I am now ...... and undaunted in any situation ......\"",
	"731310": "The memory ceased there, and the conversation in my recollection faded away.",
	"731311": "Pajasso then came to himself and realized that he was unusually sweating all over. Unsteady sounds could be heard coming from \"Faith in Star Spirits.\"",
	"731312": "Apparently, you can't go any further, handsome.",
	"731313": "I can't believe it ended just as it was about to climax. ......♧",

	"731334": "The old buildings that could have been monuments were torn down decades ago during the hyper-urbanization movement, and the retro-style architecture that has now been reconstructed is, I don't know how to say this, but at any rate, instantly recognizable as fake.",

	"731440": "That's pretty interesting. I didn't know you could manipulate Honkai energy.",
	"731441": "The power of Honkai energy has apparently expanded with the history of human development.",
	"731442": "And now, if humans undergo remodeling surgery to become recipients or are born with a sacrament, they can manipulate that immense power that originates in another universe.",
	"731443": "I wish I and my mom were both sacramentalists.",
	"731444": "The road stretches far and wide, and the trucks follow it. It is as if an endless journey continues.",

	"731461": "Wait, ...... this--",
	"731462": "Changkuu City is the new Changkuu City, right?",

	"731479": "-- [Part I, complete!] -- [Part I!",
	"731480": "The ending was terrible. What kind of development is it that aliens suddenly appear without any foreshadowing?",
	"731481": "With this feeling, I think the second part is a little less promising!",
	"731482": "The drama became more popular than expected, so there is a sense that it was stretched out too far.",
	"731483": "Oh well. We're already in the city center, so let's deliver the package as soon as possible.",
	"731484": "Well, the first thing I'm going to deliver today is .................. antiques.",
	"731485": "My car is a standard freight truck.",
	"731486": "There could be thousands of cars in the new Chang Kuai city alone ...... or even tens of thousands of cars. It's a very large city.",
	"731487": "But it's common and unobtrusive, which is why people in a business like ours use it so often.",
	"731488": "A very large city. ...... This is still a very small part of a multi-story city.",
	"731489": "Perhaps the largest city in the world? It's got to be bigger than Hermania, and maybe even bigger than the super-metropolis of the ...... Northern Legion?",
	"731490": "I'll look it up on the net later~.",
	"731491": "Hello~. I'm Karin, and I've come to deliver a package.",
	"731492": "Oh wow! This is ...... certainly the real deal.",
	"731493": "I can't believe you actually found me. You're not an ordinary guy after all.",
	"731494": "It may be very painful for archaeologists that ancient artifacts have been lost in the dead zone. ......",
	"731495": "For me, it made it even more valuable to collect as a collection, and that was a good thing.",
	"731496": "Thank you for your service! I'll take your payment then~!",
	"731497": "Of course. You really did a great job.",
	"731498": "I'm a little hungry!",
	"731499": "But it's still early for lunch and I'll have to deliver the second case.",
	"731500": "We've come all the way to a big city, we want to eat something that isn't the instant food in the car!",
	"731501": "Okay, and what's the second one: ....... Oh, a guide dog robot.",
	"731502": "Stop! This is the territory of the Evil Dragon Gang!",
	"731503": "I see. So, if you were the Evil Dragon Clan, you know where building 137 is located ...... Ouch, hey you guys, why are you throwing rocks--?",
	"731504": "Hahaha, you better tuck tail and run as fast as you can. Blondie!",
	"731505": "Well then, ...... let's destroy the Evil Dragon Clan here today!",
	"731506": "Ahahahaha! Now, tell me where building 137 is!",
	"731507": "Your sister is terrible! I can't believe you're serious with a child!",
	"731508": "But a loss is a loss, and look at ....... Building 137 is right over there.",
	"731509": "Hello~. I'm Karin, and I've come to deliver a package.",
	"731510": "Hi ...... sister, is it?",
	"731511": "What, ......?",
	"731512": "Are you blind?",
	"731513": "Yeah ...... so my dad found you guys on the internet and asked for you.",
	"731514": "He said that prosthetic eye surgery is very expensive, so he wanted to do it instead.",
	"731515": "It was. Yes, it's what you asked for.",
	"731516": "Yeah, thanks sis.",
	"731517": "Um, could you please put that on the table? Dad, I won't be home until the evening. ......",
	"731518": "No problem!",

	"731521": "ONE!",
	"731522": "Doggie!",
	"731523": "Phew, it took a while to assemble, but I'm glad it works.",
	"731524": "Ready? This pooch has a military-grade smart core on board, so it can understand natural language.",
	"731525": "So, if there is somewhere you want to go, tell him directly in words. That's right, doggie~.",
	"731526": "ONE!",
	"731527": "Military?",
	"731528": "I don't mind, I don't care. Thanks for your service. See you~.",
	"731529": "Gugu~.",
	"731530": "I was assembling it for a customer and it took a long time.",

	"731533": "No good. ....... I'd like to eat at a restaurant, but it's going to take me a little while to find one. ...... Let's just make do with the bread in the car for the time being. ......",
	"731534": "Mogmog............ yeah, thanks for the food.",
	"731535": "That's the third case next.",
	"731538": "Hmmm, I feel like I'm missing out.",
	"731539": "The whole time I was holding out for lunch, I was trying to eat something good in the big city I'd come to.",
	"731540": "...... That's one piece of bread after all. ......",
	"731541": "Not like this!",
	"731542": "That's right! I'm hungry for bread, but I'm not hungry for dessert!",
	"731543": "I wonder if there is a restaurant somewhere that looks good...",
	"731544": "......",
	"731547": "...... Whoa! There is a school called Senba Gakuen near the third address.",
	"731548": "If it's near a school, there tends to be a trendy coffee shop or something, right?",
	"731549": "Then, since we still have time, let's look around the Senba School first~.",
	"731550": "School, huh?",
	"731551": "I have always taken classes online and have never been to school.",
	"731552": "But in this day and age, there must be quite a few people like that, right?",
	"731553": "Wait a minute--",
	"731554": "Hm?",
	"731555": "I'm a student at Senba High School. ......",
	"731556": "Cute uniform. Are they girls who go to this school?",
	"731557": "I like it!",
	"731558": "And, you know, that thing over there might be--?",
	"731559": "Oh, ...... I knew this!",
	"731560": "It's the uniform of Houraiji Kyuushou!",
	"731561": "I know it too! I know that Houraiji Kyuushou, the headmaster of Honkai Academy, is the most powerful person in the world today.",
	"731562": "Gravity control--ha!",
	"731563": "I posed lightly while looking at the uniforms on display. I wasn't sure if I looked like them or not.",
	"731564": "I wish I had her kind of power. ......",
	"731566": "Over there, there are goods related to Raiden Mei. I see, both of them are originally from Senba Academy.",

	"731568": "Mumm. .........................",
	"731569": "I've decided. Let's go with Kyuushou's.",
	"731570": "Excuse me~.",
	"731571": "Is something wrong?",
	"731572": "That ...... Oh, no.",
	"731573": "Hahaha ....... And I came to buy it on behalf of my friend, but after a closer look, it looks like this isn't it. ......",
	"731574": "Besides, I'm going to be late for my next job, so I'll see you at ......!",
	"731575": "Take care.",

	"731585": "Patience patience patience! Bread will fill you up in no time.",
	"731586": "But is it okay to buy some sweets and a few other things?",
	"731588": "I'll buy it!",
	"731589": "Excuse me, can I have a glass of orange juice?",
	"731590": "Churrrr--",
	"731591": "foo~♪",
	"731592": "The smell was palpable, making hungry people more hungry and full people even more full.",
	"731593": "It looks like it would be good for when I want to eat with gusto! I don't think I can do it now.",
	"731594": "What kind of books are popular in the new Chang Kuai market?",
	"731595": "When I opened the door and entered, all I saw was educational materials all around me.",
	"731596": "I didn't want to go in the moment I peeked in.",
	"731597": "Ice cream! Please give me one!",
	"731598": "Ham-ham~.",
	"731599": "Hey, hey, hey!",
	"731600": "Wow! There is an old-fashioned newspaper stand!",
	"731601": "This is only in areas under the jurisdiction of the Southern Command, right?",
	"731602": "Which one ...... Wow, they sell prepaid cards for games too.",
	"731603": "Rhythmic music can be heard from inside.",
	"731604": "I've never been in a restaurant like this, and I'll have to check it out when I get a chance.",
	"731605": "Is this a beauty parlor?",
	"731606": "I approached, but felt a silent pressure from the decor of the store that only adult women were allowed in.",
	"731607": "At least try to touch the door railing at least--gasp.......",
	"731608": "I was played. This restaurant was too early for Karin.",
	"731609": "Yeah, I've seen most of it! I should get back to work.",
	"731612": "Okay, ......, let's go look at that Kyuushou merchandise one more time.",
	"731613": "There is still time.",
	"731614": "Ugh...... I still want it. But I don't have enough money .......",
	"731615": "Yes, if you finish delivering the package addressed to Long Sky City, the money should be transferred to your account. ......",
	"731616": "When the money is deposited, your mother will receive an allowance.",
	"731617": "Yeah, yeah, yeah, then we're good. --Let's go!",
	"731618": "The third case~. So that's two more cases, including this one.",
	"731619": "This is ...... Oh, it's the luggage of that person who is the most regular.",
	"731620": "It's easy to find the place because you go straight all the way and see the hotel.",
	"731621": "Okay, let's go~.",
	"731622": "Hello~. I'm Karin, and I've come to deliver a package.",
	"731623": "Who are you? How dare you so rudely address the Secretary of State directly? I'm a security guard...",
	"731624": "Shut up. You said you came to deliver a package!",
	"731625": "This is the core prism of the main gun of the ...... Humanity Liberation League's third fleet destroyer, the \"Innovator,\"...... which is the name of the ship. It's the core prism of the main gun of the .",
	"731626": "...... sure. You two there, inspect it.",
	"731627": "Haha!",
	"731628": "I tell you, don't salute in the long sky city!",
	"731629": "Yes, sir! Secretary!",
	"731631": "Looks like it's not a problem. ......",
	"731632": "It is utterly shameful. That we, the honored ones, should have to do research like this based on the antiquated technology of the ...... A.D. era.",
	"731633": "I'm telling you to shut up.",
	"731634": "Miss, here's your reward for this one. Give my regards to your mother.",
	"731635": "Roger that! Thanks for everything!",
	"731636": "Whew, that leaves us with one last case.",
	"731637": "Oh, it's getting dark around here. ......",
	"731638": "Night already?",
	"731639": "But it doesn't seem to be too late in time ....... Let's hurry up and deliver the last of today's packages.",
	"731640": "This way I won't have to get up early tomorrow!",
	"731641": "After that, you can play at the Long Sky Market until your mom gets back from work!",
	"731642": "All right! Let's clean this up--",
	"731643": "-- let's see ...... The last one to be delivered is .............",
	"731644": "Honkai War Memorial.",
	"731645": "Okay, let's go~!",
	"731646": "Wow, that's quite a magnificent building.",
	"731647": "I can't believe this big building was only built 5 years ago.",
	"731648": "This certainly wouldn't be surprising if they called it the new Chang Kuai City.",
	"731649": "This was another place that people forgot about until five years ago.",
	"731651": "This last item ...... is the one I finally got after a lot of hard work with my mom. I wondered who would want such a thing. It was this memorial museum that requested it.",
	"731652": "But how did the people at the memorial museum get such a heavy thing ....... Oh, I remember that there is a crane at the delivery place and it says in the remarks that it is carried by a machine.",
	"731653": "Good, good, good. Now I'll have everything delivered by the end of the day.",
	"731654": "Go inside, get the person in charge, have them unload the items, and you're all set!",
	"731656": "That's strange! I can't believe no one is at the reception: ....... Oh, I have an announcement. Let's see. ......",
	"731657": "\"Announcements ...... all of our museum staff are .......\" What?",
	"731658": "Today, all staff members - will attend the Honkai Academy's third graduation party?",
	"731659": "I see. Like this memorial, all the research facilities around here are part of the Honkai Academy facilities.",
	"731660": "In other words, you are soooo rich. ......",
	"731661": "What, wait a minute, ...... means that there is no one at the memorial now?",
	"731662": "Oh hey --------!",
	"731664": "No one comes to get angry when you yell.",
	"731665": "I knew there was no one there. ......",
	"731666": "......So ...... looking for a motel to stay at?",
	"731667": "No, no, no, I just got here by truck, but then I'd have to come back tomorrow .......",
	"731668": "Besides, even if they come tomorrow morning, if we can't deliver them right away, we won't be able to play all day.",
	"731669": "Hmmm ...... what to do .......",
	"731670": "Oh, this is a guide map of the museum.",
	"731671": "According to this, the office is located on the ............3 floor.",
	"731672": "Maybe there is someone on duty there.",
	"731673": "If the door to the memorial hall is open like this, then there must be someone there ......, right?",
	"731675": "Anyway, let's go upstairs.",
	"731680": "Sorry, I took a wrong turn!",
	"731681": "Heh-heh-heh.",
	"731682": "Da-da-da-da--!",
	"731683": "Guns were sweeping in from the front.",
	"731684": "Wow! Let's hurry up and get off--!",
	"731685": "Hmmm... .......",
	"731686": "What is that thing doing?",
	"731687": "That uniform is the Southern Army.",
	"731688": "Wasn't New Changkua City a permanent neutral city? Why are there so many armed soldiers there? ......",
	"731689": "There's definitely something very bad going on here: ....... I don't care about the delivery, I need to get out of here!",
	"731690": "...... uu.......",
	"731691": "I have little time to think about it. The people downstairs must have seen the number of floors the elevator stopped at and know that I'm on the top floor.",
	"731692": "But you can't use the stairs or ....... I'm sure we'll bump into each other.",
	"731693": "Oh, it's too much trouble. I can't just go quietly and get killed, but fighting army soldiers head on is just too much of a bad thing. ......",
	"731694": "If this happens, the only way to get there is to try to find a passageway that will take you from here to another location. ......",
	"731695": "Or we would have to find some kind of tool that would allow us to move to the roof of another building.",
	"731696": "I think I can still manage. ...... Worst case scenario, I can just climb down through the exterior wall.",
	"731697": "What a surprise! I never thought I would run into a situation like this in the most peaceful city in the southern hemisphere!",
	"731698": "But what is the purpose of the southern army coming to New Changkuo City, anyway?",
	"731699": "From the way they are dressed, it looks like they are soldiers of the three-headed alliance that was formed after the Southern Army split up.",
	"731700": "The new Changkuo City is supposed to be a separate power that was created by a split - the Southern Continental Alliance's sphere of influence.",
	"731701": "I don't understand ...... at all anymore!",
	"731702": "This is the last corridor that I can pass through.",
	"731703": "Okay, let's go to .......",
	"731704": "It's dark.",
	"731705": "It was even quieter there than outside.",
	"731706": "When the door closed, I couldn't hear everything, even the noise that normally wouldn't bother me.",
	"731707": "Is this the ...... specimen house?",
	"731708": "Unlike the outside area, there was no light source on the ceiling here.",
	"731709": "The only illumination is the light shining from under the specimen cabinet.",
	"731710": "The specimens felt like jellyfish glowing in the deep sea.",
	"731711": "In the center of those cool jellyfish is .......",
	"731712": "There was a woman's figure illuminated by a ray of cold light.",
	"731713": "Yes.",
	"731714": "A woman was standing in the specimen house.",
	"731715": "Light was reflected by the glass covering many of the specimens, reflecting countless illusions.",
	"731716": "The woman seemed to have noticed my gaze.",
	"731717": "She turned and looked at me.",
	"731719": "(eh .......)",
	"731721": "Who are you ......?",
	"731723": "That .......",
	"731724": "As I was about to open my mouth, I felt a huge, unidentifiable object suddenly attack me from the darkness.",
	"731726": "Geez--!",
	"731727": "When he turned around, he saw that the Confederate soldiers outside the door had been blown everywhere by the impact.",
	"731728": "You took them all out in an instant!",
	"731729": "I was taken aback and looked at the girl to hear what she had to say.",
	"731730": "...... still not enough.",
	"731731": "Before I knew it, the girl was right in front of me.",
	"731732": "It was very close.",
	"731733": "How about this ............?",
	"731734": "This guy--",
	"731735": "Caution!",
	"731736": "Boom!",
	"731739": "Was it a conditioned reflex? Without time to think, I pulled the girl into my arms and a bullet flew past both of us, grazing our faces.",
	"731740": "--giggity--giggity--giggity--giggity--giggity--giggity!",
	"731741": "Shall we go?",
	"731742": "The crane's winch is turning. It seems to be trying to retrieve the hook.",
	"731743": "Huh?",
	"731744": "The girl who was hugging me, who seemed to be the same age as me, murmured quietly.",
	"731745": "She didn't even ask who I was or why I was here. Her expression showed no signs of panic or embarrassment.",
	"731746": "If you don't act now, you'll die. Shall we go?",
	"731747": "Oh, ...... yeah!",
	"731748": "As the crane moved, the hook swung and hit the door again with a tremendous impact, creating an escape route.",
	"731749": "Okay, then, let's go.",
	"731750": "Elevator Elevator Elevator Elevator Elevator Elevator Elevator Elevator Elevator Elevator ...... Huh? Why is it stopped at the 3rd floor?",
	"731751": "Elevator, it looks like the enemy is controlling it.",
	"731752": "Damn, oh well. Let's take the stairs.",
	"731753": "Wow ...... there are too many ...... enemies!",
	"731754": "I wonder if there are bosses or strong opponents. It's really troublesome. ......",
	"731755": "Yes, you can call the police at ......!",
	"731756": "Hey, my phone ......, don't tell me you dropped it when you were escaping from the specimen room!",
	"731757": "Oh, I've already lost so much money! I hadn't finished paying the installments yet!",
	"731759": "Ugh. .............",
	"731760": "How do we break out of our current situation ......?",
	"731761": "It might not be so difficult if I were the only one to escape, but if I left a child as fragile as this mirror behind ...... Ugh, I don't even want to think about it.",
	"731762": "As I was thinking the thought in my head, I suddenly felt something cool touch my hand.",
	"731763": "Huh?",
	"731764": "When I looked, I saw that the girl, whose name I did not yet know, was holding my hand gently.",
	"731765": "<color=#6666FFFF>No need to panic. </color>",
	"731766": "<color=#6666FFFF>Because you won't die here. </color>",
	"731767": "<color=#6666FFFF>Because if you do what I say, you'll get away safe. </color>",
	"731768": "What? Are you talking directly to my heart, Kimi......?",
	"731769": "<color=#6666FFFF>This way the enemy can't eavesdrop. </color>",
	"731770": "Is this the power of the ...... stigmata?",
	"731771": "You're very perceptive.",
	"731772": "I see. ...... I mean, those guys were chasing after the Stigmata users at the behest of the Stigmata Bureau, right?",
	"731773": "The situation was critical. But why?",
	"731774": "Despite the circumstances, I somehow began to get a little excited.",
	"731775": "So ...... it's as if you've stepped into a storybook.",
	"731776": "Haha, I've made up my mind.",
	"731778": "You're already involved in the mess, so it's okay to do a little bit of whatever you want, right?",
	"731779": "I'm going to help you. Of course, it's for my own good, but I'm going to get away from them.",
	"731780": "Anyway, we became friends!",
	"731781": "........................ friends... ....",
	"731782": "I'm Karin, Karin Meride! Nice to meet you!",
	"731784": "My name is Arkria Holopt. You can call me Arkria if you like.",
	"731785": "All right, all right! Well then, let's do our best and get rid of those guys!",
	"731786": "Whew ...... I finally made it outside.",
	"731787": "Yeah, those guys haven't caught up with us yet, have they?",
	"731788": "Karin, why don't you use the sacrament?",
	"731789": "Stigmata...... I don't have anything like that.",
	"731790": "There it is-- follow it--\"",
	"731791": "You're so persistent...already.",
	"731792": "Let's just get it over with and get out of here in the car.",
	"731793": "Okay, it's all taken care of.",
	"731794": "Akria, get in the passenger seat - no, it's not safe to get hit by a stray bullet. ......",
	"731795": "Get on the back of the truck and hide yourself for a while.",
	"731796": "I understand.",
	"731797": "Southern soldiers, why are they so swarming ...... but anyway, I'll take care of the road!",
	"731798": "Okay, I got him. These guys look like regular soldiers whose mission is to protect the public order. I think I can handle this on my own.",
	"731799": "<color=#6666FFFF>Thank you. </color>",
	"731800": "Oh, I'm speaking directly to your heart again. That ability is soooo useful!",
	"731801": "But, in case you run into a very strong enemy or a sacrament user, the odds are against you, right?",
	"731802": "<color=#6666FFFF>You're right. </color>",
	"731803": "Well, if you want to fight, leave it to me.",
	"731804": "Oh yeah, how about I send you to Honkai Academy, Akria?",
	"731805": "Honkai Academy. .......",
	"731806": "Arkria, you were headed to Honkai Academy. No?",
	"731807": "I heard that even if you are a Stigmata user and are being hunted, if you go to the Eternal Anchor - that is, if you can get to Honkai Academy, you will be protected for at least three years.",
	"731808": "If Arkria can get there, that means it's safe for now, right?",
	"731809": "They know my face anyway.",
	"731810": "They won't give up on you unless I send you back to Honkai Academy, right?",
	"731811": "Besides, I have to deliver a package!",
	"731812": "I don't know.",
	"731814": "<color=#6666FFFF>...... Karin. </color>",
	"731815": "<color=#6666FFFF>That's not what you meant. </color>",
	"731817": "<color=#6666FFFF>You are trying to help me for more personal reasons. </color>",
	"731818": "Huh?",
	"731820": "--I'm sure you're right. The military probably knows about me, so I need someone to help me.",
	"731821": "<color=#6666FFFF>Karin. I don't really mind at all if you stick your neck out for the fun of it. </color>",
	"731823": "Arkria...... you are really perceptive. I think I really thought so,....... I finally realized it when you said it.",
	"731824": "I have a feeling that tonight is going to be very interesting--I'm not sure what--but it's going to be very interesting.",
	"731825": "--And I really like Arkria.",
	"731828": "<color=#6666FFFF>Don't say such frivolous things lightly. </color>",
	"731829": "I'm serious!",
	"731830": "<color=#6666FFFF>Yes. I'll leave it at ...... that way. </color>",
	"731831": "<color=#6666FFFF>Then--</color>",
	"731832": "<color=#6666FFFF>Karin, please help me. Take me to Honkai Academy. </color>",
	"731833": "I'll make sure to send Arkria home. I'll make sure to send Arkria home.",
	"731834": "Heh heh heh~. Anyway, how do you know so much about me even though we just met?",
	"731835": "It's like magic.",
	"731836": "I scratched my head in embarrassment.",
	"731837": "Let's see, .......",
	"731838": "Take it easy on me, Arkria.",
	"731839": "<color=#6666FFFF>It's nice to meet you too. Karin. </color>",
	"731840": "Well, enough talk, it's time to get going!",
	"731844": "Hey, where's my car?",
	"731846": "<color=#6666FFFF>I'm driving, aren't you? </color>",
	"731847": "Of course it wasn't me!",
	"731848": "I looked around quickly, not understanding what was happening at all.",
	"731849": "Then I saw an unforgettably familiar car on the street ahead of me - and I saw it about to drive away at a very high speed.",
	"731850": "Wait a minute! Wait!",
	"731851": "Who is that? Who's driving my car? My car! Get back here! I just bought a new car!",
	"731852": "Do-do-do-do ----",
	"731853": "Who is that? Who's driving my car? My car! Get back here! I just bought a new car!",
	"731855": "Let's put the situation in perspective.",
	"731856": "I am in the back of a truck. The owner of the car is a girl named Karin Meride.",
	"731857": "But now this truck is being driven by someone other than her.",
	"731858": "You cannot see the outside from the cargo bed.",
	"731859": "I don't know where the car is going now, or what kind of security is in place.",
	"731860": "That is the situation now.",
	"731861": "That's a little off from what I expected.",
	"731862": "The soldiers chasing us were weaker than expected, but I still didn't expect them to get us into trouble.",
	"731864": "Conclusion - I'm not there yet.",
	"731866": "<color=#FF8C00FF>...... are you finished ......? </color>",

	"731873": "Oh, it's so lively here. Good.",
	"731874": "The purification committee will be very vigilant here, and it should be difficult for pursuers to get their hands on it.",
	"731875": "First, let's take advantage of this geographical advantage and find out who the pursuers are.",
	"731877": "From the looks of it, the number of pursuers ...... doesn't seem to be that large.",
	"731878": "These clothes, I believe, are worn by Herrscher, Houraiji Kyuushou.",
	"731879": "No wonder. This is the transfer city of New Changkuo City to begin with.",

	"731972": "<color=#6666FFFF>Yes, it's the exact same track. </color>",
	"731973": "Yeah? Where do I go to find something like that?",
	"731974": "<color=#6666FFFF>Go to the Honkai War Memorial. And while you're there, get one of the enemy's communication devices. That way you can figure out what they are talking about. </color>",

	"731986": "<color=#6666FFFF>Because if the truck's engine or tires were shot and destroyed, we wouldn't be able to escape. </color>",
	"731987": "<color=#6666FFFF>Drive that truck and follow me for some distance. </color>",
	"731988": "<color=#6666FFFF>Because I'm going to find the right time to set it up. </color>",
	"731989": "<color=#6666FFFF>I'll explain the plan from here on out. </color>",
	"731992": "We're here!",
	"731993": "<color=#6666FFFF>As expected. I checked the map and this is the tunnel. </color>",
	"731994": "Roger that! So we make sure they can't get out of the tunnel and we beat the crap out of them, right?",
	"731995": "Only when things are at their worst.",
	"731996": "<color=#6666FFFF>Just to be sure, could you recite what you just said? </color>",
	"731997": "OKAY!",
	"731998": "First, they followed the truck with Arkria in it into the tunnel.",
	"731999": "Then, Akria will turn off all the lights in the tunnel and the convoy vehicles and jam the enemy's communications at the same time - Akria, do you have an EMP or something?",
	"732000": "<color=#6666FFFF>Well, just think of it as being able to use powers like magic. And after that? </color>",
	"732001": "After that, we're ready to ...... fight, so we can attack.",
	"732002": "But the goal was to get the enemy's attention and to create an opening for Arkria to take the car--",
	"732003": "We will fight and if we can control it, we will control it and get my truck and all my money back.",
	"732004": "If we can't control them, we'll retreat. The lights on this truck should be safe, so we'll light it up and draw the enemy's attention while we're at it.",
	"732005": "Even if you couldn't get their attention, you could take advantage of the fact that there are two trucks that look exactly alike and make what was it ...... decision making? Yes, we were going to make it difficult for them to make decisions.",
	"732006": "Once we leave the tunnel, I go to the purification committee's office near the Homme Museum. And Arkria goes to an office on another block.",
	"732007": "Oh, by the way, the enemy will follow us to the purification committee's office, right? Won't they attack us?",
	"732008": "<color=#6666FFFF>We've already investigated those two places. Honkai Academy students are doing internships there. </color>",
	"732009": "I have a backup plan ready in case of an accident. ......",
	"732010": "If it were me, I would look for a chance to attack, and if I thought I could win, I would fight! If not, I would run away! That's all I could think of!",
	"732011": "It is really amazing that Arkria can come up with such a complex plan in such a short time!",
	"732012": "<color=#6666FFFF>That's not much praise. And the more complicated the plan, the more gaps there are. </color>",
	"732013": "Arkria is really hard on herself. ......",
	"732014": "<color=#6666FFFF>I have very limited moves available to me right now. It's not a good plan, but it's what I have to do this time. </color>",
	"732015": "Oh, I get it! You're worried about me, and you want to avoid a situation where you have to go head-to-head with the enemy as much as possible, right? That's so sweet.",
	"732016": "<color=#6666FFFF>...... Well, you'll have to wait until after you get away to talk about those useless things. We're almost there. </color>",
	"732017": "Yes, ...... will be starting soon.",

	"732022": "Ladies and gentlemen, we will soon enter the tunnel.",

	"732049": "Then someone quickly jumped out the door and onto the top of the truck, and in a flash, he jumped to the wheel loader.",
	"732050": "Ugh!",

	"732536": "In any case, your mother can hear what I have just described by replaying the surveillance video, because she can also hear what I have just described. This is the way a clever person, like a schemer, would do it.",
	"732537": "Yes. .......",
	"732538": "Anyway I have already made up my mind.",
	"732539": "Well then, maids, à la prochaine~.",
	"732540": "Good-bye, my dear.",
	"732541": "It really is a strange thing to see.",
	"732542": "She is the only daughter still living of a feared, calculating, and thoughtful head of the family. How could such a person be ......?",
	"732543": "Why is he so elegant and gorgeous, fair and dignified, going his own way - stupid?",
	"732544": "I'm still in a place where I can hear you!",
	"732545": "I'm kind of tired, so I think I'll go back to my bedroom and make some plastic models.",
	"732546": "First day away from home.",
	"732548": "After all, that's what I'm all about.",
	"732549": "And so far, the family unit doesn't seem to be taking any action.",
	"732550": "Now let's fully enjoy the beautiful scenery outside the battleship.",
	"732551": "Ah, the southern land is so beautiful even when seen standing on the ground like this.",
	"732552": "I, Raniat Gordias, will finally begin my adventurous journey now, at this very moment.",
	"732553": "Second day away from home.",
	"732554": "You have not responded. Does this mean that your mother is too old?",
	"732555": "By the way, these doughnuts are really delicious. Manager, can I have two more, please?",
	"732556": "Fourth day away from home.",
	"732558": ".............................. If ........................... ...",
	"732559": "Mother--",
	"732560": "Do you not think anything of my running away from home?",
	"732561": "Fifth day away from home.",
	"732562": "I'm so bored I'm going to ruin ....... ......",
	"732563": "Are you sure that nothing will really happen as it is? We are almost at Changkuu City!",
	"732564": "Sixth day away from home.",
	"732565": "Hey, you!",
	"732566": "What the hell?",
	"732567": "What? Yes, yes, I'm coming~!",
	"732568": "Please wait. Is there a problem? I, ...... of the Gordian family, no, there is something different. How should I introduce myself in such a situation ...... I am ...... that ...... I am.... ....",
	"732569": "You know what? You're a really nice guy!",
	"732570": "You're a pretty nice guy, too. I'll buy you a drink, let's go!",
	"732572": "I am Laniat, a street justice. How can I help you?",
	"732575": "Um, there you go, young lady.",
	"732576": "Can you give that bottle of water you just finished drinking to my grandma?",
	"732577": "Uh, yeah. ............ Okay. Please take it.",
	"732578": "Day 7 of running away from home, in the city of Changkuu.",
	"732579": "What?",
	"732580": "What?",
	"732581": "Ehhhhh?",
	"732582": "Maid! I have already arrived at Changkuu City, though!",
	"732583": "Please don't shout so loud. The marker line was about to get bent.",
	"732584": "Besides, didn't you say you won't see me for a while?",
	"732585": "But ...... my smartphone, voice calls work, and I miss you guys so much, and that's why I'm talking to you like this, okay?",
	"732586": "And since I grew up on the Battleship Eumenes, I have no other friends to chat with. So please visit ...... and join me for a chat!",
	"732587": "And ...... why hasn't your mother sent soldiers after you? I don't think your mother is the only one who hasn't noticed yet. ......",
	"732588": "The division has already reported it to the master. After hearing this, our master said that it doesn't matter whether or not we capture Miss Laniat. ...... The master said, \"I will tell you exactly what he said. I will tell you exactly what he said. ......",
	"732589": "She's an idiot anyway.\"",
	"732590": "You are the idiot!",
	"732591": "Miss, I have prefaced this, haven't I? I only told you exactly what the head of the family said.",
	"732592": "If we continue as we are, ...... we will be able to enter Honkai Academy without incident on the road. ......",
	"732593": "Miss, can you still continue to complain?",
	"732594": "I was really looking forward to this great adventure, and now it has come to an end without even a ripple on .......",
	"732595": "Dear Miss ......................... I know this is very rude and out of place, but may I give you a word of advice?",
	"732596": "What is it?",
	"732597": "Your daughter looks extremely cool as long as she keeps quiet.",
	"732598": "If you want people to think you're a great person, ............ don't say anything.",
	"732599": "Yes, ...... I am indeed very cool.",
	"732600": "If you don't believe this advice, try it out and stare at someone and see how they react.",
	"732601": "You may indeed be right.",
	"732602": "If your daughter feels the same way, please put it into action as soon as possible.",
	"732603": "I understand. Have a good day. I'll go now.",
	"732604": "Now you can finally continue with your plastic model at ....... I wish you the best of luck, Miss. My most beloved daughter.",
	"732605": "Beep!",
	"732606": "...... Transfer City, New Changkuo City. So this is where my story begins.",
	"732607": "Let's look around first.",
	"732608": "Oh ...... what's this?",
	"732609": "This is Houraiji Kyuushou's uniform when he was a student, isn't it?",
	"732610": "I cried and screamed when I was little and had one made for me by a maid. ......",
	"732613": "She is the most powerful being in the world and ...... the only hero who has signed a contract with the four great legions, right?",
	"732614": "If I could be a hero like her, I am sure I could change the world.",
	"732616": "And you can change your mother, you can change the Southern Legion, and you can change the World Legion.",
	"732617": "Hmmm...we will go to Honkai Academy to verify all this.",
	"732618": "'Do you want to catch them here? No, this place is a little hard to reach. .......\"",
	"732620": "I didn't expect him to flee all the way to Nagora City. ......",
	"732621": "I just heard ...... maybe .......",
	"732622": "That clever little brat. He took advantage of a little gap and ran away to Changkuo City.\"",
	"732623": "\"If we don't catch them today, we'll have an uncollectible rate of ...... for the season.\"",
	"732624": "Don't worry. The manager has found out that the kid is most likely a sacramentalist. He's going to dispatch a strong force to Changku City to assist us. ......",
	"732625": "\"If you catch that guy and bring him back, I have the license plate number of the ...... vehicle down, and the ...... license plate number is .......\"",
	"732626": "(Hmmm...what?)",
	"732627": "(Okay, I could hear the ...... number.)",
	"732628": "(I'm sure this means ...... that ...... hunters are trying to hunt the Stigmata users.)",
	"732629": "(I never thought that there are people trying to do such a thing here in the new long-empty city. ..................... ................)",
	"732631": "Hm!",
	"732632": "But how do we tell ...... the targeted person that they are in danger?",
	"732633": "No. Those who are being chased by hunters must surely be less competent than the hunters.",
	"732634": "But if the hunters are really coming in heavily armed ...... I don't think I can compete with them with my current strength.",
	"732635": "What might be useful in such a case is ...... a prop used in horsemanship--not the all-purpose key ......, but a transmitter that can track a target! It's a transmitter that allows you to track your target!",
	"732636": "Flatten.",
	"732637": "This will allow us to keep track of the movements of those who are chasing us. I had brought some things from the armament lab before we left that I thought would be useful this time.",
	"732638": "I am indeed.",
	"732639": "So let's go to ...... and arrange for one of our cars to track it down as soon as possible.",
	"732640": "My plan, it's going so much better than this!",
	"732641": "Oh, my dear lady. It's so easy for me. By the way, please tell this laniat your name: ......\"",
	"732642": "Hm-hm-hm~",
	"732644": "Later that same night.",
	"732645": "Okay, ...... I see that the transmitter has stopped. The location appears to be the Honkai War Memorial. ...... driver, can you please pull over?",
	"732647": "Boom-boom-boom--!",
	"732648": "This is ......fun, you have already started to engage? But according to the display on the device, the one being chased seems to be in the back of the vehicle.",
	"732649": "Could it be that the pursuing forces had a run-in with some people from Honkai Academy?",
	"732650": "Anyway, the first priority is to protect the target. I have never driven a car before, but I will drive here to get the target to safety!",
	"732652": "The car seemed very easy to drive. I quickly started the engine and started the truck.",
	"732653": "Who's driving my car? Who's driving my car? My car! I told you to go back! I just bought a brand new car!",
	"732654": "Oh? I thought I heard something behind you.",
	"732655": "It was so windy I couldn't hear you very well.",
	"732656": "-- Trucks drive through the wide street.",
	"732657": "Bub~!",
	"732658": "Is it a horn?",
	"732659": "It looks like ...... passenger cars are on the way.",
	"732660": "Which unit is in the truck? Who are you?",
	"732661": "...... That outfit looks like a unit belonging to the three-headed alliance of the Legion here.",
	"732662": "Who are you and what unit are you in?",
	"732663": "What's with the smart mouth?",
	"732664": "Wait, Private First Class, look closely.",
	"732665": "Judging from his free dress and equipment, this man may be one of the Marshal's Guard.",
	"732666": "Marshal ...... SS? You mean someone at the top came out of nowhere?",
	"732667": "No matter how tight the budget is, there is no way they would send us alone, without the power of the sacrament, on a mission to pursue the princess.",
	"732668": "But this person looks much younger?",
	"732669": "You don't understand.",
	"732670": "I've been reading a lot of ancient and modern examples of battles. I have a knack for recognizing my opponents.",
	"732671": "It's - the powerful stigmata users are usually beautiful girls who look about 16 or 7 years old and wear unique costumes.",
	"732672": "Oh, is that so!",
	"732673": "I've actually been putting a lot of effort into studying such fashions lately.",
	"732674": "The person who appeared to be his boss touched his nose in a somewhat embarrassed manner. What on earth are those two talking about?",
	"732675": "So it was! Now all mysteries are solved.",
	"732676": "It looks like the formation has broken down. What the hell are those people doing?",
	"732677": "Oh well. Anyway, as long as I can get the person in the back of the car to Honkai Academy, my mission will be a success.",
	"732678": "This is how I ended up in combat with you guys. Afterwards, I was scolded ---- tightly by Akria for sorting out all the circumstances.",
	"732679": "You, don't be so self-serving with your recollections!",
	"732680": "That's why I said .......",
	"732681": "But it's strong. ......",
	"732682": "You're talking nonsense and taking out all your enemies.",
	"732683": "Yeah ...... but it's too early to be reassured. We haven't killed them all yet.",
	"732684": "You're still here!",
	"732685": "Tiara, these are the debt collectors who came after you, right?",
	"732686": "Eh? In any case, that means you're a ...... bad guy!",
	"732687": "What do you mean? There are three more people than reported! What the hell are they doing?",
	"732688": "Wow oh wow, it sure looks like it!",
	"732689": "Karin?",
	"732690": "Yeah, got it! So let's get rid of these guys here ----!",
	"732692": "Ok, easy, easy, easy......did we get it all done?",
	"732693": "We'd better stay alert. There could still be a force following us.",
	"732694": "So ...... what are you going to do now ......?",
	"732695": "Hmmm.",
	"732696": "Anyway, now that my car is back, I can drive you to the Honkai Academy reception desk.",
	"732697": "Are you sure?",
	"732698": "Of course. We fought together and I like Tiara a lot.",
	"732699": "What?",
	"732700": "And I'm also talking about Laniat. He shot at me a lot.",
	"732701": "Oh, I am honored by your compliment.",
	"732702": "I'm not complimenting you.",
	"732703": "Let's go anyway~.",
	"732704": "What happened earlier......? Ugh.................. I feel like ...... I've been busted all over my body! .......",
	"732705": "Gosh gosh gosh ...... ugh ...... dying .......",
	"732706": "What are you ......, some kind of remnant of their support squad or something?",
	"732707": "Who are you ......? You're the one who dressed up as a member of the Three Horsemen's Alliance. ......",
	"732708": "What? Are you going to do it?",
	"732709": "Miss ------!",
	"732710": "Hm? Where is your daughter? Looks like I'm another step too late, huh?",
	"732711": "These guys are ......! Rebels who call themselves the Coalition Forces! What are you guys doing in Chang Kuai City?",
	"732712": "Who are you?",
	"732713": "In the first place, isn't Changku City originally under the jurisdiction of our military? Why should I be the only one to say my name? ...... But still, you guys are badly beaten up. ...... What the hell happened here?",
	"732714": "I am under no obligation to answer questions from traitors.",
	"732715": "I see. Then have you seen a woman with pale gold hair, wearing white clothes and a red cape, and skilled in the use of weapons?",
	"732718": "Tsk. ...... almost caught the target.",
	"732719": "",
	"732720": "Why is it that after the recollection is over, they all unite and become very strong?",
	"732721": "It's true, isn't it? Do they think they are the heroes?",
	"732722": "Recollections. .......",
	"732723": "Boss, hey ......!",
	"732724": "What do you think, okay?",
	"732725": "It's a cool camera! But why did you suddenly decide to buy such an antique-looking camera?",
	"732726": "I signed up for a mission. The mission was to bring back a young lady of the Gordian family, and the place was .......",
	"732727": "Where is it?",
	"732728": "And what a surprise it is! It's the famous tourist destination - the transfer city, New Changkuo City!",
	"732729": "Heh!",
	"732730": "No - I have always wanted to see the Eisei anchor at a glance and have dinner in the Senba High School cafeteria someday.",
	"732731": "I would love to go eat there and take pictures too!",
	"732732": "I'm sure you will. That's when you will need this camera.",
	"732733": "I see!",
	"732734": "But still ...... I wonder where the in-camera is on this .......",
	"732735": "Secretary, Secretary!",
	"732736": "Yeah, I was just thinking about it.",
	"732737": "--I thought it looked roughly like this: .......",
	"732739": "So we are all chasing different people, and each of us is being chased by a different person, but somehow the girls are working together?",
	"732740": "Unfortunately, that's what ...... seems to be about.",
	"732741": "Tsk, I don't know if this is supposed to be a big hero rally or what. If this keeps up, the ...... mission is going to fail.",
	"732742": ".................. right?",
	"732743": "So how about the three of us here at ............, how about we reconcile?",
	"732744": "Huh?",
	"732745": "Hm. ...... You have a point. Okay, reconciliation, reconciliation.",
	"732746": "Even those kids, with whom we've never had any contact, are cooperating with us, so why shouldn't we?",
	"732749": "",
	"732750": "Stop--!",
	"732751": "What?",
	"732752": "Do-o-o-o-on: ----!",
	"732753": "Finally ------！！！！",
	"732754": "I found ------ ！！！！",
	"732755": "Do you want me to say something? Let's see... ...... Anyway, go quietly into the noose!",
	"732756": "Wow, why are those people suddenly getting along so well!",
	"732757": "As Arkria said earlier, they really are after me again!",
	"732758": "But - can you keep up with my speed?",
	"732759": "Ugh. ......!",
	"732760": "Report. Target found.",
	"732761": "If you run left, you can go to ......!",
	"732762": "Mr. Secretary, we have blocked the left side of the target.",
	"732763": "Damn. .......",
	"732765": "Hm, our remaining forces may not be enough, but if the three of us join forces, it will be enough.",
	"732766": "You shouldn't be so overconfident. According to the navigation system's display, she is heading for a tight curve ahead. Never give her a chance to escape.",
	"732767": "Naturally, we've blocked off the road ahead of you. Don't underestimate us. We ---- are highly trained and highly capable soldiers.",
	"732768": "Totally, I said I would unite, but ...... I'm kind of sick of you already.",
	"732769": "Hey, our unity is too fragile. ......",
	"732770": "But considering that we are still in the middle of a civil war, wait, wait, wait--stop, stop, stop, stop!",
	"732771": "Don!",
	"732774": "This is ......!",
	"732775": "That unidentified blonde woman, no way. ......",
	"732776": "Did you have an accident?",
	"732777": "Puhahaha, totally makes me laugh. I can't believe I hit a car parked on the street. ......",
	"732778": "Ugh. .......",
	"732779": "Wait a minute ...... that guy .......",
	"732780": "Ehehe~.",
	"732781": "You there, stop.",
	"732782": "...... That guy ran into a cleanup committee enforcement vehicle.",
	"732783": "Sorry, sorry, I was just a little careless and rubbed it.",
	"732784": "Hmmm...I thought ...... the speed you just described would be enough of an impact to make a hole, but ...... you're right, it was a bit of a scrape.",
	"732785": "You, my friend, are in luck.",
	"732786": "What do we do? Should we just get it all done here at once?",
	"732787": "Isn't there something wrong with ......? When they were all thrown into the purification committee camps, all we had to do was watch outside the gate. What the hell is that guy thinking?",
	"732788": "Is there anyone else in the car? Everybody get out.",
	"732789": "In the car?",
	"732790": "There's no one else in the car. Shall I open the door?",
	"732791": "!!!?",
	"732792": "What do you mean? No way. ...... No way. ......",
	"732793": "............ got me.",
	"732794": "The other three people ...... we were chasing have already gotten into another car and gone somewhere else. Somewhere in the vastness of the New Chang Kuah City.",
	"732795": "I'm done. ...... my business performance is .......",
	"732797": "Let's both go to ...... already.",
	"732798": "She should be left to the purification committee.",
	"732800": "Ha, he's really gone. Well, Arkria, my plan worked, didn't it? How's it going over there?",
	"732802": "I guess I've exceeded the distance we can communicate ...... but I don't have a phone.",
	"732803": "Then I also ...... the sister of the purification committee, I got the bill for the fine, so I can go now, right?",
	"732804": "Yes, .............",
	"732805": "Well then, bye~bye.",
	"732806": "........................ Oh?",
	"732807": "Wait a minute.",
	"732809": "Your car, you've changed the license plate number.",
	"732810": "Huh?",
	"732811": "Ehhhhh?",
	"732812": "That's right ...... I'm not ...... I'm not ...... Tiara is ......!",
	"732813": "I'm sorry to say that young people have a lot of learning to do, but all they do is learn bad things.",
	"732814": "Come with me and cool your head for a while.",
	"732815": "Ugh. .............",
	"732816": "Ugh. .............",
	"732817": "Eeeeeeeeee!",
	"732818": "Get me out! Get me out of here! I've been falsely accused! I'll talk to the chief in person, I want to see him!",
	"732819": "'Hey, shut up neighbor. This is just a gulag, not a prison or anything. ...... gape .......\"",
	"732820": "Oh, sorry, I just wanted to say something.",
	"732821": "All the prisons I've been to before were places that didn't look like prisons. ...... This is not a prison, so why does it look like one? ......",
	"732822": "Are you a habitual offender? .......\"",
	"732823": "No, no, no! I just went to ...... to pick up a package, I didn't do anything else.",
	"732824": "I'm not a bad person!",
	"732825": ".......\"",
	"732826": "It's true!",
	"732829": "Ahhhh ...... I'm kind of bored without my phone.",
	"732830": "Oh, I hadn't finished the daily quests on my phone game yet! I'm sure it's updated by now. ......",
	"732832": "Very quiet.",
	"732834": "But that's once and for all the series of events this evening, right?",
	"732836": "I don't feel like I'm really feeling it at all!",
	"732837": "But ...... was pretty interesting.",
	"732838": "Oh well, I've stopped thinking about this and that.",
	"732839": "Yes, speaking of the purification committee, ...... your mother told me about it before. ......",
	"732840": "Oh yes, I remember your mother saying that the new Chang Kuai City is special. ......",
	"732841": "Since the death of the Commander of the Southern Command about five years ago, the army has split into dozens of warlords.",
	"732842": "Then the civil war lasted for three years, leaving seven warlords who could eventually take over the Southern Army.",
	"732843": "I think it was a 4 to 3 ratio, the Confederation of the Southern Continent and the Triumvirate, respectively, and both claim that they are the official successors to the Southern Army.",
	"732844": "So one of them has the flagship of the Southern Command, and there's a new Changkuo city in the territory of the other. ......",
	"732845": "Which one was ...... that has the new Changkuu city in the territory?",
	"732846": "South Continental Union.",
	"732847": "The Confederation of the Southern Continent is a federation of warlords created by four stigmatic military nobles of roughly equal strength, and New Changkuo City is located within its territory.",
	"732848": "However, since the four warlords are almost equally powerful, they are not willing to follow each other's lead, and no one warlord has actual control over Changku City.",
	"732849": "And there is also the presence of Herrscher, Houraiji Kyuushou. Therefore, it can be said that Honkai Gakuen holds the highest power in Changkuu City after all.",
	"732850": "The Honkai Academy's operating expenses are covered by the transfer device in Changkuu City and the tariffs generated by the use of the three other transfer devices.",
	"732851": "Meanwhile, the four legions of the Confederation of the Southern Continent entered into a covenant with Herrscher to prevent him from interfering with changes in external affairs.",
	"732852": "So the city of Changku has remained conspicuously free of control by the four warlords, and the presence of Herrscher has prevented the warlords from garrisoning their forces there.",
	"732853": "But it is still the military of the Southern Continental Alliance that has the most pervasive influence in Changku City.",
	"732854": "Wow, I don't know who you are or where you are from, but you know a lot!",
	"732855": "Well, not so much. I'm in graduate school and my specialty is contemporary corps relations.",
	"732856": "But why are they in the camps?",
	"732857": "We had too much to drink and were debating the ...... situation when we got into a fight and I got handsy.",
	"732858": "......On the other hand, the Three Heads Alliance, or should I say the Southern Legion War Arbitration Committee...... they like to call themselves that. As for that one, it is composed mainly of the SS, in which Marshal Avignon of the Southern Legion had the most confidence.",
	"732859": "They have neither the economic power nor the military size of the Confederation of the Southern Continent, which is made up of local warlords. ......",
	"732860": "But they are united with each other, and the cadre at the center is also a former central force of the Southern Legion, so they outperform their opponents in terms of the ability and will to carry out the operations that the troops have.",
	"732861": "I see.",
	"732862": "I don't know how you suddenly came up with that, but you seem to know quite a bit.",
	"732863": "Of course. I'm a teacher of Modern Corps Relations.",
	"732864": "But why would someone like that be in a camp?",
	"732865": ".............................. I was drinking too much ....... I was debating with a student about the situation and we got into a fight and ended up getting into a fistfight and ...... I ended up losing.",
	"732866": "The Three-Headed Alliance may appear to be less powerful on the surface, but it is actually being financed behind the scenes by the Eastern Army. So the Trinity Alliance should eventually win the civil war.",
	"732867": "Someone else in the know. Okay, you're a professor of modern corps relations or something, right?",
	"732868": "Let's see, I'm just a military geek who likes to talk about this and that about international affairs on the internet at ....... I couldn't help but speak up when I heard him talking. Ignore me.",
	"732869": "Okay, I got the general idea. ......",
	"732870": "...... but mom, when you told me this story, I think you emphasized something, what was it?",
	"732871": "Ta, ta, ta, ta. .......",
	"732872": "Click!",
	"732873": "You, get out.",
	"732874": "Whoa, ha~yes.",
	"732876": "Go forward.",
	"732877": "This place doesn't look like an office or anything?",
	"732878": "No idle talk is allowed.",
	"732879": "(Yes, ...... the Southern Continental Alliance people who were chasing Laniat, if they have enough influence in the new Changku City, ...... there are still many breathing forces lurking here and there in Changku City. That means .......)",
	"732880": "(Oh, okay.)",
	"732881": "Okay, ...... I think we'll be fine here.",
	"732882": "(Mom, I probably meant to say--there are a lot of people on the Purification Committee who have the breath of the Confederacy.)",
	"732883": "Be honest. What was your relationship with the three people who were originally in the car, and where are they now?",
	"732884": "Yeah!",
	"732885": "Ugh--!",
	"732886": "If that's the case, I can't stay here much longer. I was thinking of staying here for a night to commemorate the occasion, but I'm going to go now.",
	"732887": "You, hey--!",
	"732888": "I don't think you should move. You can't beat me. I don't want to beat a police officer either. ...... but is the purification committee even a police department in the first place?",
	"732889": "Well, you shouldn't waste your time.",
	"732890": "Kuk ----!",
	"732891": "Hmmm, should I just let him pass out? Oh no! He's trying to hit the alarm button!",
	"732892": "Don!",
	"732893": "Bo, the button is broken!",
	"732894": "I know it's a sniper ....... But you're saying you shot through this at the right time? Through several walls? ...... Yes, we have to get these people out of the way first than that!",
	"732895": "Ugh. ..................",
	"732896": "Boom!",
	"732897": "Is this another one of those ...... fistfights kind of things? Sorry~!",
	"732900": "You can leave from here: .............",
	"732901": "Gee--",
	"732904": "(...... to fight?)",
	"732905": "Yeah, that's her.",
	"732906": "Huh?",
	"732907": "Just as I was about to use my ability, I saw an unexpected situation.",
	"732908": "Behind the door was a large hall for administrative procedures, and Arkria was sitting in the reception room. She was staring in my direction through the mirror in the reception room.",
	"732909": "When Arkria saw me, she stood up and walked toward me.",
	"732910": "What? Arkria? What's the situation?",
	"732911": "She did not answer my question, but took my hand in hers.",
	"732912": "I'll bring her right back to you. Thank you for all the trouble you have caused the committee.",
	"732913": "Oh, yeah.",
	"732916": "Take care.",
	"732918": "Arkria, what do you mean? Why did you come back? You said I'd draw their attention away from us.",
	"732919": "Because you are worth helping.",
	"732920": "I knew things were a little strange, and I acted quickly.",
	"732921": "Hmmm ...... I'm tired. I wish I could work overtime again today or ...... skip work.",
	"732922": "Tiara?",
	"732923": "Oh, you're a high school girl? Would you like to have tea with your sister?",
	"732924": "Is this ......?",
	"732925": "The purification committee member who led you out earlier, Tiara, was manipulating you.",
	"732926": "By the looks of it, it's probably some kind of side effect of the power of the stigmata. Let's leave it alone.",
	"732927": "So it's totally okay to come out like this on ......?",
	"732928": "First of all, the purification committee is not the police.",
	"732929": "The New Changkua City Landscape Remediation Committee is in a rather delicate position due to the fact that it was created under an arrangement that does not allow the military to be stationed in the city.",
	"732930": "The purification commissioner also serves as a tourist guide, is in charge of city management, and combines the duties of traffic police and crime control police, but the fact that the purification commission has no right to take people into custody in the first place is not widely known.",
	"732931": "So if you don't actively protest, you can be locked up in a camp for a while for remorse or taken into custody for a while for a fine reduction.",
	"732932": "The person who is after Laniat, would have been a soldier of the Confederation of the Southern Continent. They originally had personnel hiding inside the purification committee who could be used to push for Karin to be taken into custody.",
	"732933": "She was so worried about it that she wouldn't listen to me when I told her I was going to take Karin out.",
	"732934": "Tiara was also shy at first, but after being persuaded by the two of us, she realized how sorry she was for what she had done to Karin.",
	"732935": "Phew~! There are so many high school girls here!",
	"732936": "I see, so you are here to help me.",
	"732937": "Thank you, Arkria. I love Arkria after all.",
	"732939": "Huh? You're not shy this time. Even though Arkria is cute when she's shy.",
	"732940": "You'd be saying the same thing to anyone anyway.",
	"732941": "How did you know!",
	"732942": "I think that what you call liking is different from what people usually think of liking. So I am not ashamed of it.",
	"732943": "Yeah, that's for sure.",
	"732944": "So if I had meant it in a special way, would Arkria be embarrassed?",
	"732945": ".......",
	"732946": "What are you waiting for? We don't have time to talk. Get in the car quickly.",
	"732947": "That's not fair, I wanted to say that too!",
	"732948": "And ...... car is my car to begin with!",
	"732949": "A good horse answers to the best of its ability to those who can ride it. I felt this through today's adventure.",
	"732950": "That there is a strong bond between you and this child. Isn't that right?",
	"732951": "Bub~!",
	"732952": "Don't just push the horn yourself! Get out of the driver's seat quickly!",
	"732953": "Laniat, if someone comes after us again, you are the only one who can snipe. So could you please go to the back of the truck where the gun stand is easier to fix?",
	"732954": "We need your help to protect us.",
	"732955": "Is it ...... that you are protecting? Hmmm...you are indeed right. I'll take care of it!",
	"732956": "Ehehe~, my car~ (rubbing) I missed you so much~!",
	"732957": "So, then, I guess my next stop should be the reception of Honkai Academy, right?",
	"732958": "Yes. First you go to the Honkai War Memorial, and then you go straight on.",
	"732959": "We were supposed to be there tonight after 8:00 pm, but we have been going in circles ever since. Strange things happen.",
	"732960": "Hey, who do you think is responsible for that?",
	"732961": "I really hate these stigmata hunters!",
	"732962": "Ugh............ what am I doing here? Didn't I say something weird earlier?",
	"732963": "\"Oh, high school girl? Would you like to have tea with your sister?\"",
	"732964": "Gaaaahhhh ！！！！",
	"732965": "I'm not going to school anymore: ！！！！ If I go to school, I'll be classmates with you guys for the rest of my life!",
	"732966": "What am I going to do for the next three years ahhh!",
	"732967": "Ugh ...... because I'm too hungry and my energy is limited. Otherwise I wouldn't be in this situation .......",
	"732968": "Yeah, I'm a little hungry if you ask me.",
	"732969": "I agree with you.",
	"732973": "How did it go?",
	"732974": "I understand ............. Yes, yes.",
	"732975": "Beep!",
	"732976": "What did he say?",
	"732977": ".................. They have been run off.",
	"732978": "That's enough. I'm going to get a C this year anyway.",
	"732979": " Give me a bottle!",
	"732980": "What is the use of you guzzling tea like that? I was kind of thirsty after making the call too.",
	"732981": "In any case, it looks like our mission has completely failed.",
	"732982": "General! I can't apologize to the Marshal for this!",
	"732983": "I haven't had a drink yet, so how did I end up like this? Well, it's OK. Manager, please rent the place out today. First, bring the liquor! Please put out ......2 cases of Nagora City's specialty beer for now!",
	"732984": "Have you both become desperate because you can't carry out your ...... mission?",
	"732985": "...... That's what makes you sound like a businessman! Manager, give me three cases!",
	"732989": "Ugh ............ you drank a lot. ......",
	"732990": "What, the Southern Continental Union is already screwed after drinking this much? This is not even close to my sister who just graduated.",
	"732991": "What the heck...... ugh...... then I'll go to the front desk and ask for an extension. I'll still drink .......",
	"732992": "Oh ...... I still have to come up with the SS themselves. ......",
	"732993": "Why don't you send the hunters? Who are you guys after? I can't believe you would even think of carrying out the former SS of the General.",
	"732994": " Well, it's not a big deal, that's why they sent in unimportant units like ours.",
	"732995": "............ Hey, you of the Confederacy of the Southern Continent. The next time we see each other after we leave Changkuo City, we'll be enemies.",
	"732996": "But this is still a long-empty city. People of the Three Headed Alliance, just for tonight, we are friends too.",
	"732997": "....... He's a good talker at all. ...... He looks so young. ......",
	"732998": "Whew ...... you guys are good people. I always thought the guys in the southern army were all rugged and bad with people.",
	"732999": "I've never been to the southern territories to collect a debt before, but the reality is very different from what is said in the media.",
	"733000": "If that's the case, why don't you move to the South? The Southern Continental Alliance needs people with good marksmanship.",
	"733001": "I'm not a sacristan, and I'm not going to make a name for myself in the south. I'm better suited to my family's place.",
	"733002": "I'm going to keep on getting better and better and ...... I'm going to be a famous person someday, I'm going to be a really famous person. I'm going to be really great.",
	"733003": "I feel kind of light-headed and good. ......",
	"733004": "That's right......Upp......Eh, I had to sign up for an extension......I had to tell the manager... ..........",
	"733005": "Sir, what can I do for you?",
	"733006": "Um, the table we're using, I'd like to request an extension of time. ......",
	"733007": "Manager~. Is the take-out you ordered ready? I'm here to pick it up.",
	"733009": "I think I've heard this voice somewhere before: .......",
	"733010": "Ah.",
	"733011": "Ah.",
	"733012": "Ah.",
	"733013": "Two women are standing in front of you.",
	"733014": "At that moment, I felt as if time had slowed down very much.",
	"733015": "What should I do in this situation? Should I draw my weapon? No. Should I warn them? Or should I take evasive action?",
	"733018": "No good. We have to hurry. Quickly. But why am I moving so slow like a turtle crawling? These two guys are already moving their hands, and yet they are ...... these two guys ---- so strong!",
	"733019": "They've already taken out their weapons .................. and at an incredible speed that I can't even explain. --",
	"733020": "Ouch!",
	"733021": "Agh!",
	"733022": "They smashed into each other's faces.",
	"733027": "(Glancing.)",
	"733028": "Clack, clack, clack, clack.",
	"733029": "(You're eating choc ...... chocolate at breakneck speed ...... with no expression on your face.)",
	"733030": "One more.",
	"733031": "(Arkria Holopt ...... something ...... that ...... something ......)",
	"733032": "(He's so damn scary!)",
	"733033": "(...... And what's the deal with Arkria and Karin, anyway?)",
	"733034": "Yeah. .......",
	"733035": "(Aww, did you notice I was saying this and that about Arkria, and you're mad?)",
	"733036": "Let's put it this way.",
	"733037": "（Why did you start the truck all of a sudden? What's going to happen to me? Will I get put under the tires and run over a bunch of times?)",
	"733038": "(\"Tiara, ugly skanks like you are an eyesore and I'll have you off the face of the earth before my quince returns.\" -- or something like that?\")",
	"733039": "(Scary, scary, scary, Karin help me! Laniat help me! When are you coming back ...... make a fuss and get Aqria's attention!)",
	"733040": "Oh hey ----",
	"733041": "(I'm back!)",
	"733042": "Everyone left with food. -----",
	"733043": "Miss, we won't let you get away with it!",
	"733044": "Stop!",
	"733045": "I brought my pursuer with me while I was at ----!",
	"733046": "My percentage pay--! You won't get away with this: ！！！！",
	"733047": "Heehee!",
	"733048": "The engine is already on. Tiara, open the door. And go with Laniat to the living area.",
	"733049": "What? Huh?",
	"733050": "Don't just stand there.",
	"733051": "Hiyi, yes!",
	"733053": "Driving on the road.",
	"733056": "How do you think you're going to get away with it?",
	"733057": "It may be impossible. There are more people than us.",
	"733058": "And it's late at night, so there's no way to block the flow of cars or anything.",
	"733059": "Yes ...... because we are sure where we are going .......",
	"733060": "They could have sent one of their units to the Honkai Academy's reception area, where they could have ambushed us.",
	"733061": "As it is, you can go to ...... when you get to your destination.",
	"733062": "We'll be pinched between the pursuit force and the ambush force.",
	"733063": "So you think Arkria should ...... fight aggressively here?",
	"733064": "But ...... that's just a possibility, right? And the pursuit force behind you looks pretty formidable too. ......",
	"733065": "Why bother fighting when you might not have to? ......",
	"733066": "I'm just saying you're right, that's a possibility.",
	"733067": "What do you think Karin?",
	"733068": "Me?",
	"733069": "Yes, I am. Karin, Karin ...... are you ......? Ya, it's not like I really have to say what I think. ......",
	"733070": "You're all asking me for my opinion? Let's do it this way.",
	"733071": "Raniat, Tiara, and the two prepare to block the pursuit.",
	"733072": "My gut is telling me that if I don't beat the pursuers here, I will be surrounded before I reach the school.",
	"733073": "Stop them from pursuing us? What do you mean?",
	"733074": "I understand. But where are you going to fight?",
	"733075": "There's no other place I know of, so let's go with ......--The Honkai War Memorial.",
	"733077": "Ugh ............ my head is spinning. Oh, a very big bump.......",
	"733078": "Beep--",
	"733079": "Did someone send a message?",
	"733080": "Wow ...... where did my communication device go ......?",
	"733081": "......All-you-can-eat barbecue, you say? Everyone is eating all-you-can-eat barbeque and they want me to come? Is the mission over already? What the hell happened while I was out cold?",
	"733082": "Did someone just say all-you-can-eat barbeque?",
	"733083": "Sounds like all-you-can-eat barbecue to me?",
	"733084": "Hey, wake up quick, everyone - get up early and let's go to the all-you-can-eat barbecue!",
	"733085": "Oh, that happened?",
	"733086": "All-you-can-eat barbecue. ------!",
	"733087": "You've been beaten up and you still have such energy!",
	"733088": "If ...... this is what you call a yell before a fight?",
	"733089": "Laniat, can you cover me with a sniper?",
	"733090": "No problem.",
	"733091": "Tiara, I'd like to use your battle mech for an endo.",
	"733092": "Bo, you want me to fight too? Don't expect too much ...... Oh, what I meant to say is that it's okay ......!",
	"733093": "Arkria, go to the upper floors and secure yourself. The rest is the same as before.",
	"733094": "<color=#6666FFFF>Okay. Leave it to me to support and direct our communication with each other. </color>",
	"733095": "This is directly in your brain: ......!",
	"733096": "Now let's get wild! Let's see how I, Laniat, work!",
	"733097": "Well...",
	"733098": "Let's get it over with!",
	"733099": "Done and done. Now all we have to do is wait for Arkria to come down.",
	"733100": "Oh, by the way, ...... is that ......?",
	"733101": "............. ............ yeah?",
	"733103": "The fight, it's over.",
	"733104": "(Let's meet up with everyone.)",
	"733106": "Ah, Arkria!",
	"733107": "Look, look! What do you think? Isn't this amazing?",
	"733108": "I didn't realize there was a place in the memorial where you could experience the Great Honkai War era!",
	"733109": "And you can play for 100 yen!",
	"733110": "Karin, you--",
	"733111": "Please let me experience it soon!",
	"733112": "Tiara tiara, take a picture of us!",
	"733113": "Okay, let's take a shot!",
	"733114": "You guys .......",
	"733115": "Wow. ...... is this the kind of thing you're into? Sorry, I just got carried away. ......",
	"733116": "I'm such an inconspicuous piece of trash, but I've got to get on with it and get mixed up with you guys. ......",
	"733117": "Please put this camera away!",
	"733118": "Let's take a picture with Arkria too!",
	"733119": "I'm not really ...... well ...... okay.",
	"733120": "Kasha!",
	"733121": "I am satisfied and happy. It was worth the trouble to come all the way to Changkuu City!",
	"733122": "You guys really have no sense of urgency.",
	"733123": "No, no, no, I'm a scaredy-cat anyway, so I was super scared.",
	"733124": "It's time to get serious.",
	"733125": "The pursuit force has been taken care of.",
	"733126": "All that's left is the remaining troops.",
	"733127": "We have our forces cut down, but we can't let our guard down because they must be waiting for us in ambush.",
	"733128": "If there are any Southern troops left, they could be preparing ...... large weapons.",
	"733129": "Large weapons or .......",
	"733130": "What? ...... Chang Kuai City is a permanent neutral city, right?",
	"733131": "Yes. My guess is we're going to see some big weapons.",
	"733132": "With the horsepower of my truck, I would never be able to break through if my path was blocked by a military armored vehicle.",
	"733133": "Tiara, how powerful is your combat mech? Can it break through an armored car or something?",
	"733134": "Uu...... don't think it's possible. Gigantics are made almost entirely of civilian components, so they won't have enough power.",
	"733135": "Then how about .......",
	"733136": "Don't worry.",
	"733137": "What?",
	"733138": "Karin, you have another item on the back of your truck that has not been delivered.",
	"733139": "Oh, you mean that one?",
	"733140": ".............................. .............................. ........................-- I see, that one might work!",
	"733141": "What are you guys talking about?",
	"733142": "Ah, I see what you mean. That one ...... that one!",
	"733143": "What's that?",
	"733144": "Yes, that's it!",
	"733145": "Which one?",
	"733146": "No, ...... leave Laniat alone. You don't know him.",
	"733147": "We have ......------ \"Porcupine\"!",
	"733148": "Gu oh oh oh oh--",
	"733149": "Hey guys, are you done eating your dinner? --I'll be there soon!",
	"733150": "Are you ready?",
	"733151": "You can't tell me it's not done. ......?",
	"733152": "Come on in.",
	"733153": "Keep attacking. I don't think the academy will sit idly by if we make such a big deal out of this. We have to hurry.",
	"733154": "I never thought that you, ......, would be so bold as to take a large weapon to Chang Kuai City.",
	"733155": "Would you go that far ...... to catch a stigmata user?",
	"733156": ".................. You guys don't get it at all.",
	"733157": "There's a really big weapon ...... acreage that I can understand that much.",
	"733158": "I was the first one to say that, wasn't I?",
	"733159": "You're on anyway--Porcupine: ！！！！",
	"733160": "Porcupine?",
	"733161": "Excuse me? Porcupine? No way. .......",
	"733162": "Well, the first time that delivery woman showed up was at the Honkai War Memorial. That place is part of Honkai Academy.",
	"733163": "So what's the point?",
	"733164": "No doubt. The advanced infantry fighting vehicle that was once ridden by the First Legion's renegade ...... \"cold iron\" that existed in the past--.",
	"733165": "Don, Don, Don. .......",
	"733167": "Kittaka. ......!",
	"733168": "Bwah!",
	"733172": "This can be found at .......",
	"733173": "Yeah, my mom and I went through a lot of trouble to finally catch this rare--",
	"733174": "Porcupine-shaped Honkai beast!",
	"733175": "Maybe it's because I study Honkai biology at Honkai Academy? I got an order for this~.",
	"733176": "Is this a porcupine? It looks a little different from what the book describes!",
	"733177": "...... Karin, this is a wild boar, not a porcupine.",
	"733178": "What?",
	"733179": "Yes, this is a wild boar.",
	"733180": "What? Wild boars aren't worth anything at all. I worked so hard to catch it, but it was just a useless bone!",
	"733181": "I didn't realize the First Corps had such advanced biotechnology. ...... I thought only the Northern Army could do research on biomimetic weapons. ......",
	"733182": "No, no, ...... says this is just a wild boar.",
	"733183": "Well, porcupine or boar, either would be useful in the current situation! Come on, Boutaro!",
	"733184": "Buch!",
	"733185": "What, maybe he's still sober? Why do I have to fight ...... such a big boar? Why am I here? Where did my life go wrong?",
	"733186": "You'll have to think about it later, ---- or the boars will run into you. ！！！！",
	"733187": "Doodle-doodle-doo!",
	"733188": "Oh, the tank that was blocking the road has been blown away.",
	"733189": "I think he just woke up and is in a bad mood.",
	"733190": "Aaahhh!!!\"",
	"733191": "Don!",
	"733192": "Bu ...... hic .......",
	"733193": "Laniat, can you check to see if everyone has lost their will to fight?",
	"733194": "There is no one left who has the strength to fight ...... on this battlefield anymore.",
	"733195": "Well done! Boutaro!",
	"733196": "Is everyone okay with ----?",
	"733197": "It's okay.",
	"733198": "We will be fine. Even if more reinforcements come, we can still fight.",
	"733199": "Reinforcements? I'll die if they come. ......",
	"733200": "Okay, so ----",
	"733201": "We won!",
	"733203": "Me, I feel like I am missing something.",
	"733205": "Oh, that? That!",
	"733206": "That one. .......",
	"733207": "Yeah, I kind of get it too. ...... That's it, right?",
	"733208": "Yes, that one.",
	"733209": "It doesn't feel right that the four of us are walking side by side and there is no explosion behind us.",
	"733210": "I'll get up.",
	"733211": "Do--------n!",
	"733212": "It really happened! Arkria, how do you know?",
	"733213": "Well, just think of it as having magic in it.",
	"733214": "It's better not to talk right now. In times like this, we are supposed to shut up, be cool, and keep walking forward.",
	"733215": "Atch ...... back .......",
	"733216": "This is .......",
	"733217": "Yes, ...... this train will take you to the Eternal Anchor. And then - by transferring from the Eternal Anchor - you can get to Honkai Academy.",
	"733218": "I see. Honkai Academy is not located in Nagora City.",
	"733219": "No one knows the specific location of Honkai Academy.",
	"733220": "It's kind of very strange.",
	"733222": "So, Arkria is going on this one, right?",
	"733223": "Yes, I did. Thanks for all your help today. Karin.",
	"733224": "Yeah, bye-bye.",
	"733225": "Oh? Karin is not coming with us?",
	"733226": "Yeah, because I don't have a sacrament.",
	"733227": "I've heard that apart from the ...... protection route, there is another way to get in by taking an entrance exam, which is also available for those who don't have a stigmata.",
	"733228": "That's right.",
	"733229": "Maybe I'm in the mood for a little serious study.",
	"733230": "Karin Meride, please make an effort and follow my steps! I, Honkai Academy, will be waiting for you!",
	"733231": "If Karin studied and passed her exams and came in, she can be found at .......",
	"733232": "Will you be a Boku ...... senior?",
	"733233": "Karin. .......",
	"733234": "That's enough. Just go.",
	"733235": "I will definitely catch up with everyone.",
	"733236": "See you next year!",
	"733237": "Good-bye.",
	"733239": "This machine, this is how it is used.",
	"733240": "Well, today was very interesting.",
	"733241": "Well, what am I going to do now? I guess I'll just look for a place to sleep.",
	"733242": "Ah, yes.",
	"733243": "I have to call home first.",
	"733244": "Uu...... why ...... such ...... uu.......",
	"733245": "Hello - do you have a smart phone?",
	"733246": "Ugh ...... what ......?",

	"733253": "Hello? Mother?",
	"733254": "How was your day?",
	"733255": "Mm-hmm~.",
	"733256": "This one was super fun. It was more fun than last year when I robbed a water purification filter at Site-04.",
	"733258": "What?",
	"733259": "You said you remembered something you forgot to tell me at the time?",
	"733260": "I can't believe how forgetful your mother is. Is there something you want me to buy for you?",
	"733261": "I'm at the Chang Kuai Market, so I'm sure I can buy anything I need.",
	"733264": "...... eh? What ------!",
	"733267": "First you arrive at the school, then you go through the screening process, and finally you meet with the teacher.",
	"733268": "I've been busy, but I'm finally ready to officially enroll.",
	"733270": "This will successfully complete the first phase of the project, and you will receive the protection of the Honkai Academy.",
	"733271": "It was generally as expected, though.",

	"733355": "After getting off the station with the students and walking around for a while, I finally found a familiar landscape. I felt the scenery spread out before me and the school in my memory overlap.",
	"733356": "Oh, yes, there is a teaching building down the street.",
	"733358": "We went on for a while and arrived at a classroom where they were just holding some kind of meeting.",
	"733359": "I opened the door and entered, and it was dark inside. The light shining in from outside illuminated the inside slightly, and many cold gazes could see that it was there.",
	"733360": "They all seem very serious.",
	"733361": "Many of the teachers at the academy were former graduates of the school, and others had served as officers in various corps. Others had unknown backgrounds and should not be pursued.",
	"733362": "This is the school of Kyuushou, Houraiji, and the situation of the place as a military fortress, as it is widely known, remained the same.",
	"733363": "Close the door.",
	"733364": "I nodded and sat down in an empty seat without saying a word.",
	"733365": "And this--",
	"733366": "It melted into an iron-like darkness.",
	"733368": "Why don't you turn on the lights?",
	"733370": "--Okay. Let's start the meeting then.",
	"733371": "Let's see, is ...... available here?",
	"733372": "(Wait a minute. .......)",
	"733373": "I elbowed the stylized teacher who was sitting next to me.",
	"733374": "What's wrong?",
	"733375": "Why is that girl here?",
	"733376": "Her name is Ms. Sirin. She is a former student of ours and completed all of her general coursework three years ago.",
	"733377": "I'm sorry. I actually used to be roommates with her, so I know about that.",
	"733378": "--You're a freshman in tactical science, aren't you?",
	"733379": "The reason I'm here is ...... well, I guess I'm kind of a faculty advisor. I'm mostly speaking for the dean at these meetings.",
	"733380": "I see. .......",
	"733381": "Okay, now to the point.",
	"733382": "I have been asked by Dr. Isalin Liebtruth's project in the Jianchuan Department to send someone from our department to ...... again this year.",
	"733383": "So, everyone, as you did last year, please recruit students and give them the opportunity to make the most of their abilities and passions.",
	"733384": "I see. ....... .......",
	"733385": "Things have really changed in the three years since I graduated.",
	"733386": "Ugh ...... the sun is ...... glaring~! My eyes are ...... glaring!",
	"733387": "Hmm~!",
	"733388": "Good morning! I'm!",
	"733389": "Whose package is to be delivered today?",
	"733391": "...... Yes.",
	"733392": "I was admitted to the school.",
	"733393": "And the stigmata were awakened, too. ............ It's not a dream, is it?",
	"733394": ".................. good!",
	"733395": "Come on, show me your power! Anything you want, just make it cool, okay? My special ability --------!",
	"733397": "I'm not getting any kind of response from .......",
	"733398": "Oh well, I'll try again later.",
	"733399": "Oh, by the way, your mother said you don't need help with deliveries from now on, but do you think you can handle it on your own?",
	"733400": "Oh no, what time is it, 9:40 or ......?",
	"733401": "Is everyone awake? Let's go check on them~♪",
	"733402": "By the way, this student dormitory is very spacious, isn't it?",
	"733403": "I've seen a lot of different school dorms in the ...... anime, maybe the biggest?",
	"733404": "I wonder if they thought about students putting weapons and ammo in their rooms. You are really thoughtful in every detail.",
	"733405": "Good morning~! Arkria, are you awake?",
	"733406": "Wow!",
	"733407": "That's what I'm talking about, Arkria. I just feel like I can do a lot, and I've already cleaned up my room.",
	"733408": "All the supplies handed out by the school are organized like a showroom, and the bedding is carefully folded.",
	"733409": "I must have slept in this bed yesterday, and not a single wrinkle remains on the sheets.",
	"733410": "Hm?",
	"733411": "...... I suddenly felt that there was something slightly unnatural about it.",
	"733412": "It's kind of like .......",
	"733413": "Like, \"I don't want to leave a trace that I was here, because I could leave here at any moment.\"",
	"733414": "...... I'm sure it's all in my mind. But Arkria, where did she go?",
	"733415": "Good Morning~! Raniat~!",
	"733416": "Good morning. Please have a seat.",
	"733417": "Laniat sits gracefully on the couch.",
	"733418": "He holds a saucer in one hand and a gold-encrusted teacup in the other with a familiar hand.",
	"733419": "I just finished my morning routine and was just resting. Would you like a drink, Karin?",
	"733420": "AAAHHHHH!!!!\"",
	"733421": "An anguished cry came from the next room.",
	"733422": "Thanks~♪",
	"733423": "Gulp.",
	"733424": "Yes, yes, it's fragrant and sweet! Even just water looks kind of expensive when you drink it in a fancy tea cup, doesn't it?",
	"733425": "I took a drink of water and looked around Laniat's bedroom.",
	"733426": "It's kind of very unexpected. ......",
	"733427": "There is nothing strange about it. I, Ranit Gordias, am the next miracle woman, so it is perfectly normal for me to do things that people find surprising.",
	"733428": "I haven't said anything yet!",
	"733429": "I was really worried when I saw you cleaning up last night, but here you are in the morning, all cleaned up. I was a little surprised.",
	"733430": "If you think that's so surprising, I'm sure I'll be surprising Karin and unhinging her jaw every day from now on.",
	"733431": "Click! Thud!",
	"733432": "What's that noise?",
	"733433": "I turned toward the sound and saw that the closet door was open. Then a lump of cloth with a futon, clothes, and other items gathered in one place came tumbling out.",
	"733434": "I was really surprised!",
	"733435": "As soon as I thought a pale golden shadow had snatched me, the closet door closed with a loud bang. And before I knew it, the lump of cloth lying on the floor was gone.",
	"733436": "How did you bring such a big piano into the bedroom?",
	"733437": "I mean, how did you get it into the academy?",
	"733438": "Me, I sent everything I wanted to take out of the house before I ran away from home to the Long Sky City.",
	"733439": "I don't know if you can even take these things out and call it running away from home. ......",
	"733440": "Good morning, Tiara! Are you alive?",
	"733441": "Wow, there's garbage everywhere.",
	"733442": "Tiara, where~?",
	"733443": "\"Oh ...... oh .............\"",
	"733444": "Oops, there you go.",
	"733445": "Apparently, the white, furry, round thing lying on the floor is a Tiara.",
	"733446": "What's wrong?",
	"733447": "Net net, internet! I want to do the Internet!",
	"733448": "The white fluff swelled up at once like a stimulated harisenbon.",
	"733449": "What the heck, you've been making noise since midnight, but it wasn't over yet.",
	"733450": "I've been patient, I've been ...... trying to get online after I've finished putting things away. ......",
	"733451": "But when I thought I was done cleaning up, I went to ...... and the damn line here is extremely slow! I worked so hard to clean it up!",
	"733452": "You know, if you say that the park is cleaned up in this condition, even the garbage collection area can be called a clean park.",
	"733453": "The game's login bonus ...... late night video patrol ...... and my catcoins .......",
	"733454": "You still care about that catcoin thing?",
	"733455": "I've been patient! I knew that the general affairs wing of the academy would start handling the window at 6:00 a.m., so I stayed awake all night waiting for 6:00 a.m. to come around!",
	"733456": "Would that mean that Tiara is the earliest person in this dormitory to get up? No, no, she didn't sleep in the first place.",
	"733457": "So I waited until 6:00 to go to the general affairs building and they told me I couldn't do the ...... procedure!",
	"733458": "I thought Tiara was a commie, but she can interact with people properly.",
	"733459": "That's the thing, when I was going to the general affairs building, I bumped into Arkria ...... and .......",
	"733460": "I didn't ...... explain anything in particular, but Arkria seemed to know what I wanted to do, so she took me .......",
	"733461": "Maybe you could talk to the doctor in the ...... general affairs building and look him in the eye?",
	"733462": "Ugh. ...... It's not that you absolutely have to look them in the eye when you talk to them. ......",
	"733463": "But hey, why didn't they do the online procedure?",
	"733464": "It says you can't do business procedures until you've ...... activated your privileges with your student ID, or until you're officially ...... enrolled. I'm not sure if that's true or not, but I'm not sure.",
	"733465": "What? Does that mean we haven't been officially admitted yet?",
	"733466": "...... official enrollment will be ...... after the recruitment of students is completely finished and ............ the first test is done. After the first test is over, ............ said ............ Kuu.... ....",
	"733467": "As if to say that she had used up all her strength, Tiara shrank back into a round, white frizz.",
	"733468": "I see. Anyway, it's a lot of work to use the Internet, isn't it?",
	"733469": "Then, how about I take you to breakfast?",
	"733470": "..................Ummm...... that... ...I ...... actually don't like daylight. ......",
	"733471": "Vampires!",
	"733472": "I'd really like to see if the ...... school has an intranet and direct access to it ......... I'd like to take a look at it....",
	"733473": "Yes, yes. I'll ask Laniat then.",
	"733474": "'Sweet, sweet, you fools ...... ffff. Did you think you could get Tiara to cut off her Internet connection just like this? Don't underestimate me!",
	"733475": "Everyone seems to be kind of busy. What are we going to do now?",
	"733476": "Yes, let's find out where Arkria went.",
	"733477": "Tonton!",
	"733478": "Who?",
	"733479": "I'll put in the doorstep for the new student dormitory orientation packet.\"",
	"733480": "Thanks~.",
	"733481": "Let's see, ............, you say you have only one document, or ...... that one.",
	"733483": "There was not much written about it. It was written about welcoming new students and that it would take some time to produce uniforms and equipment as soon as the number of students entering the school was determined, because they are valuable.",
	"733484": "And, as Tiara mentioned earlier, it also said that most of the authority would only be granted after passing an examination. However, there was no mention of what exactly that authority was.",
	"733485": "There was also a QR code at the end of the manual from which the school's dedicated app could be downloaded.",
	"733486": "Hmmm...the app has a map feature. I'll get to ...... right away, then. I lost my phone. ......",
	"733487": "Karin, didn't someone knock on your door earlier?",
	"733488": "Yeah. Maybe a senior member of the student council.",
	"733489": "Laniat came out of her room, saw me reading the manual, and peeked in to see me.",
	"733490": "Oh yeah, Laniat has a smartphone, right?",
	"733491": "Yes.",
	"733492": "Download this app.",
	"733493": "I understand.",
	"733494": "-- I tapped on it and it downloaded immediately. Then what do you do?",
	"733495": "I finally came to the academy, so I thought I'd look around.",
	"733496": "I'm going to take a walk around the campus and look for Arkria, would you like to go with me?",
	"733497": "Yes, ...... it would give me a good idea of the terrain of the academy, and I'm fine with that.",
	"733498": "Would you like to take Tiara with you?",
	"733499": "I just heard he's not going. Let's go, just the two of us.",
	"733500": "I see, so a typical school dormitory has a swimming pool.",
	"733501": "This will allow me to jump in from the dorm building whenever I want to swim. ...... Well done design.",
	"733502": "That being said, I felt like this was no ordinary school.",
	"733503": "It's so big! It was late at night yesterday, so I couldn't see it, but when I looked at it like this, I realized how big it is.",
	"733504": "I don't see much difference.",
	"733505": "Yes, let's take a look at the app. What's nearby?",
	"733506": "I'll take a look at it. ......",
	"733507": "Oh, is it surprisingly small?",
	"733508": "Could it be that all the rest of the building is just an optical projection - and that the Honkai Academy is just a small place?",
	"733509": "We don't know yet, so I'm not going to say that.",
	"733510": "What's wrong?",
	"733511": "We're both freshmen, right?",
	"733512": "Yes, I am a member of the Board of Directors of the company. My name is Ranit Gordias de Eumenes.",
	"733513": "I'm Karin. Nice to meet you!",
	"733514": "You're so energetic. I'm a sophomore, which means I'm your senior.",
	"733515": "Senpai, what's wrong?",
	"733516": "You see, this is the season of entrance to school, right? That's why the school asks second-year students to take care of the new students.",
	"733517": "If you have any questions, you can find a student dressed like me and ask him or her a lot of questions.",
	"733518": "I see. I'll take your word for it then. ......",
	"733519": "This is a student dormitory.",
	"733520": "The dorm you guys moved into was occupied by a third-year student who had just graduated.",
	"733521": "Just west of here, there's an area where the construction students live.",
	"733522": "What's the construction department?",
	"733523": "Honkai Academy is not only training warriors, but also various other human resources. In fact, scientific research is also conducted in the construction department.",
	"733524": "How do people enroll in the construction department?",
	"733525": "Exams.",
	"733526": "I miss ....... I used to ask those questions to the seniors who took care of me when I first started school.",
	"733527": "I'm here on a training consignment for the Eastern Army. I've been in junior high school, and after going through a number of selections, I finally got in here.",
	"733528": "I see that you are on a training commission for the ...... army.",
	"733529": "Does Laniat know anything about it?",
	"733530": "This is a system in which students are sent by the four major corps to study. Each corps requests Honkai Academy to educate its students.",
	"733531": "Oh - Laniat, look at that!",
	"733532": "Yes?",
	"733534": "Amazing!",
	"733535": "It looks like it's made up of multiple levels of ....... This academy is even larger than a typical battleship that also serves as a living space.",
	"733536": "It's like one town.",
	"733537": "Do either of you have any questions?",
	"733538": "Passageway.",
	"733539": "-- Oh, you want to know about what lies ahead.",
	"733540": "There's a train that connects the campuses. You guys must have come on that one when you enrolled, but didn't you recognize it?",
	"733541": "Last night ...... when you say it, I'm sure I didn't look closely enough.",
	"733542": "Honkai Academy is built on a large floating island consisting of multiple floating modules.",
	"733543": "And that train connects the multiple floating modules. The train runs around the main island.",
	"733544": "Then, Laniat, why don't you and I take a train ride and explore the whole school together?",
	"733545": "That's odd. .............",
	"733546": "That's not possible. The only places you can go now are the four major transfer cities and the H-zone where you are now, because your new student ID is not authorized until you take the exam.",
	"733547": "I see. ...... Too bad.",
	"733548": "Honkai Academy...... As I recall, there used to be a school in this world that was built on a floating platform in the sky.",
	"733549": "Yes, there was. You mean the Special Military Academy of the First Corps.",
	"733550": "It was mentioned in a document kept by the Gordias family, but I wonder if there is any relationship between these two schools. ......",
	"733551": "What's the matter, Laniat, you're not talking about anything serious. ...... Don't tell me you have a cold!",
	"733552": "I always have a decent story to tell, though, don't I?",
	"733553": "What? .......",
	"733554": "They used to hijack small airplanes and parachute drop them because the air traffic control wasn't very strict over Changkuo City.",
	"733555": "I didn't know there was such a ...... cool good way to do that. ...... I wonder if I could apply for re-enrollment or something to parachute down too. ......",
	"733556": "So what happened to that plane?",
	"733557": "It didn't really matter. I went to the cockpit to try to take over, and it was a student who was also piloting the plane. The kid had switched with the pilot and was trying to get into the school by himself. She is now my roommate.",
	"733558": "As you can see, this is a diner!",
	"733559": "You're freshmen, aren't you? The payment function on your student ID card is already activated. Also, you'll have some money deposited in advance so that you can start living in Japan even before you complete the enrollment process.",
	"733560": "That means the money is being transferred from the academy to ......!",
	"733561": "Yes~.",
	"733562": "Wow. Honkai Gakuen-kun, how are you so rich?",
	"733563": "It's the most powerful educational institution in the world, and it's funded by the various corps.",
	"733564": "The world's most powerful ...... funding .......",
	"733565": "I will not tell you a lie! The president of our school has instructed us that we are not allowed to accept financial aid in any form. But it is not forbidden for students to receive aid.",
	"733566": "Yes, that's right. That's what I mean, Karin.",
	"733567": "Not at all, you're in good shape. ......",
	"733568": "This is because they have the right to collect customs duties.",
	"733569": "When you transfer in the four major transfer cities, you have to pay a tax that goes into Honkai Academy.",
	"733570": "That's why Honkai Academy is able to station inspection teams in each corps, build various facilities as part of its assets, and control Changku City and keep the world order.",
	"733571": "----",
	"733572": "This is getting rather complicated, isn't it? Let's change the subject here - have you guys decided what you're going to eat? I highly recommend the steamed meat buns in the cafeteria.",
	"733573": "I wasn't originally planning on enrolling~. I used to be a bounty hunter~.",
	"733574": "Around that time, I tried to rob a certain sacrament hunter of something he had, but I noticed that he was a very cute girl. Then I decided to protect her, so I enrolled in the school on the spur of the moment, so to speak.",
	"733575": "She's now the kind of girl who doesn't even blink when she's beating the crap out of people, but she's so cute!",
	"733576": "Kk, that's very cool. ...... I'm kind of a little frustrated.",
	"733577": "There you go, there you go, relax relax relax~♪",
	"733578": "Karin, is it possible that your habit is ......?",
	"733579": "This is the general affairs building.",
	"733580": "Here you can do general procedures for general affairs, for example, repairing air conditioning and water heaters, re-purchasing uniforms, procedures for using the internet, renting weapons, etc. -- and it says so in the application.",
	"733581": "That's convenient! I wonder what kind of weapons they have.",
	"733582": "Speaking of which, Karin doesn't seem to be very good with firearms, is she?",
	"733583": "Ahehe~ Actually, yes!",
	"733584": "I'm broke and have to save money. So I prefer close combat where I don't have to buy bullets.",
	"733585": "No money, is that it? ...... I can't imagine what it would be like. ......",
	"733586": "I don't envy you in the least. ...... Ugh. ...... gusun.",
	"733588": "Ha! I was just resting a little! I'm not slacking off--",
	"733589": "What, juniors? You scared me.",
	"733590": "This is the general affairs building. New students don't need to come here.",
	"733591": "Well, if I pass the exam, I'll be here often. You know, to pick up equipment, or to submit a reflection.",
	"733592": "What's a reflection letter?",
	"733593": "That's right. For example, if you use an appliance that consumes a lot of power and shuts off the breaker in the dormitory, you will be asked to submit a report.",
	"733594": "Is it an appliance with high power consumption? ......",
	"733595": "Using electric pots and pans, or using electric kettles for four people at the same time?",
	"733596": "But the dorms were equipped with kitchens and refrigerators, and unless you did something really reckless, you wouldn't trip a breaker that easily, would you?",
	"733597": "The ones that consume a lot of power: ...... I didn't know that. I was thinking of installing a security system in my bedroom once I get settled, but I guess I'll have to reconsider.",
	"733598": "What, does a security system need that much power?",
	"733599": "I don't know on what scale, but it's probably fine. The person who was actually punished did something stupid like taking the power supply from the dorm to test the EMP.",
	"733600": "Me?",
	"733601": "I don't understand it either. My advisor somehow got me to go along with the whole thing. They told me that it would be advantageous for me to get a job after graduation.",
	"733602": "When I received my student ID card, I found out that my sacrament had awakened before I knew it. Thanks to that, I was able to enter Honkai Academy. Well, I guess I was lucky, wasn't I?",
	"733603": "I'm generally like that. You guys also have to be careful not to get rolled in the palm of your hand by your faculty advisor~.",
	"733604": "Is this the teaching building?",
	"733605": "Yes, it does. That's what the map says.",
	"733606": "I see. I'll ask my seniors~.",
	"733607": "This is the faculty building. You are new students, right?",
	"733608": "The entrance exams you'll be taking in the future will be held in this building.",
	"733609": "Yes and no! What happens if I don't pass that test?",
	"733610": "Don't worry, you won't be rejected. The entrance exam is only to evaluate your basic skills, not to reject you.",
	"733611": "However, if your exam score is in the bottom of the class, you will be able to access .......",
	"733612": "If it was Billi, please contact ......?",
	"733613": "It is a secret!",
	"733614": "Stingy~! Why don't you just tell us?",
	"733615": "Karin, I don't need to pester you like that.",
	"733616": "Why?",
	"733617": "I, Ranit Gordias, would never have been last in the exam grades.",
	"733618": "This exam is my chance to win first place and let mothers know how great I am.",
	"733619": "I'm well aware that Laniat is strong. But if Laniat showed that much confidence in me, on the contrary, I'm getting worried. ......",
	"733620": "Hmph~ good luck to both of you.",
	"733621": "I passed the entrance exam and got in.",
	"733622": "I'm a construction student. I've solved countless practice problems, passed my tests, and here I am.",
	"733623": "I'm getting a headache just listening to the exam ...... practice questions .......",
	"733624": "What do you do in the construction department?",
	"733625": "I do a lot of different things. In my case, for example, I am working on a weapon that I will handle alone. Maybe one day we will be able to cooperate with each other.",
	"733626": "Cooperation?",
	"733627": "Yes. Construction students can ask the tactical department to test their facilities and equipment. This way we can collect experimental data and you can get credit for your work.",
	"733628": "Is this about right? After looking around, I feel like I've broadened my horizons all at once.",
	"733629": "This flooring ...... is probably equal to, or even superior to, the quality of those used in military applications!",
	"733630": "The other thing I'm wondering about is ...... yes! I'm wondering about club activities and such. Do you think Laniat will be in any sports? Like soccer or basketball? I've never played any of them, but they sound really interesting.",
	"733631": "With this facility, you don't have to worry about destroying it if you fight with all your might. ......",
	"733632": "But how do I get down there?",
	"733633": "Head north and you'll find the elevator.",
	"733634": "This is the exercise area on deck H-1.",
	"733635": "I'm telling you, don't throw anything down here. Whatever it is, you will be punished immediately.",
	"733636": "Yeah, yeah, it's dangerous to throw things from high places!",
	"733637": "The entrance exam that you guys are going to take, some of it will be done here. It might be a good idea to have a look at some of it before you actually take the test. It would be a disaster if you get lost on the day.",
	"733638": "I'm a sacristan.",
	"733639": "We bludgeoned those who stood in front of us, and relying on intrigue, force, and friends, we eliminated all the sacrament hunters who appeared with their sights set on our lives, and entered this academy fair and square.",
	"733640": "So, what kind of sacramental power does your senior have?",
	"733641": "I can't tell you that.",
	"733642": "There are still a few survivors on the list I have. So I don't intend to stay in the academy after graduation.",
	"733643": "Besides, there's always the possibility that someone you meet here will stand in your way as an enemy. Including you and others you pass in the area.",
	"733644": "I'll teach you anything but the stigmata, so please forgive me.",
	"733645": "What, anything! Then I'd like to know the three sizes of ...... seniors!",
	"733646": "96-58-98.",
	"733647": "They really can teach you anything!",
	"733648": "Kun Kun Kun ...... Diner!",
	"733649": "What kind of menu will we have? I'm looking forward to it~♪",
	"733650": "Is it a cafeteria? ...... I have never eaten in a place called a cafeteria.",
	"733651": "Ugh ...... still holding out here!",
	"733652": "I'll invite Tiara to come and eat with us after we've been around a bit more.",
	"733653": "If we ate alone, we wouldn't be able to come to the cafeteria by ourselves, and we'd probably hold back even if we were hungry. ......",
	"733654": "Or you are likely to eat only junk food. ......",
	"733655": "Ugh ...... I can easily imagine Tiara slurping down a cup of noodles she ordered online. ......",
	"733656": "Karin。",
	"733657": "What?",
	"733658": "...... Oh, hey? That look on your face, are you trying to start a fight?",
	"733659": "It was not my goal yesterday to reach a winner with Karin. So I did not reach a conclusion until the end. ......",
	"733660": "I'm curious about--",
	"733661": "Which is stronger?",
	"733662": "I'm sorry, but I think I'm stronger than you right now.",
	"733663": "Are you that confident because you have awakened to the Stigmata? However, if you underestimate this Raniat Gordias, you will be in for a world of pain.",
	"733664": "When I said \"for now\", I was referring to the timing.",
	"733665": "Before Laniat could react, I reached out and patted her on the shoulder.",
	"733667": "...... indeed. There is no chance for me to win at this distance.",
	"733668": "Laniat took a step backward when she said that. Then she looked at me and took another step back.",
	"733669": "He continued to back up and took about 15 meters away from me.",
	"733670": "If you get this far away, you can go to .......",
	"733671": "Do you think you can win?",
	"733672": "I lowered my center of gravity and prepared to jump out at any moment so that Laniat could hear me.",
	"733673": "Oops. .......",
	"733674": "Laniat sensed something and jumped back two more steps. The moment Laniat landed on the ground, I felt the \"sense of superiority\" disappear from me.",
	"733675": "Yes, I no longer have the feeling that I will always win.",
	"733676": "That's roughly the distance.",
	"733677": "Yup.\" Now he says, \"This distance would be a good match.",
	"733678": "I will be closing this distance gradually from now on.",
	"733679": "That's a lot of confidence, isn't it? I don't intend to stay at the same level forever either.",
	"733680": "I understand. But Karin, you don't know about the sacrament that has been passed down in my family, do you?",
	"733681": "What?",
	"733682": "The sacrament passed down through the Gordian family has the power to \"draw out more destructive power the deeper the understanding of the target\".",
	"733683": "The more you understand, the stronger you get, like, for example, knowing your opponent's sacrament?",
	"733684": "Yes. But the real value of this ability is that it also \"gives you the power to guess.\" If it's right, that is.",
	"733685": "So you're saying that the more ...... smart you are, the more power you have?",
	"733686": "Hmph. Therefore, I can say that this is a suitable sacrament for me.",
	"733687": "...... It's a fitting stigmata for sure.",
	"733688": "Oh, and by the way, Karin is a Stigmata user too, right?",
	"733689": "The power of the stigmata you possess - oh, I misspoke. You don't have to tell me.",
	"733690": "Actually, I don't know.",
	"733691": "My mom told me out of the blue that my stigmata were awakening. I did find a pattern that looked like it, but I still couldn't ...... feel it yet.",
	"733692": "I can't beam, fly, or dive into the ground. The only thing that has changed is that I run a little faster, but nothing else.",
	"733693": "Was that so? .......",
	"733694": "Gooooooo~.......",
	"733695": "I'm kind of hungry. Laniat, would you like to go out for lunch?",
	"733696": "What time is it? Yes, indeed, it is already lunch time.",
	"733697": "Yes, you can ask Tiara on her phone.",
	"733698": "I understand.",
	"733700": "Oh?",
	"733701": "Tiara, what did you say?",
	"733702": "She does not want to go out because of her stomach problems.",
	"733703": "Have you been sick? This is a tough--",
	"733704": "Wait--",
	"733705": "He ran off at a great pace. ......",
	"733706": "I think I'll go check on them too.",
	"733707": "Hahahahahaha.\" You saved my life! I'm a genius!",
	"733708": "When I opened the door, Laniat had just rushed in as well.",
	"733709": "What is this, a disease?",
	"733710": "This must be the so-called ...... \"phenomenon of somehow getting well just before death\"!",
	"733711": "'Whoa, who's that? La, Lani ...... why are you coming in here without permission--help me! Don't take my clothes off!!!!\"",
	"733712": "I will examine your body! Do as I say--\"",
	"733713": "Ugh ............ hiccup .......",
	"733714": "You should let him go now. He's not sick.",
	"733715": "No. Tiara's body is shaking worse. And sweating. I'll touch her some more to make sure. ......",
	"733716": "He said it would get worse if I touched it any more.",
	"733717": "Right, Tiara?",
	"733718": "Yes, yes, yes, hahahaha stop it, stop it! Wah! Please don't go any lower than that. ......",
	"733719": "Really?",
	"733720": "I have survived all kinds of illnesses, so there is no doubt in my mind.",
	"733721": "I see. I'm glad you are safe.",
	"733722": "Boom!",
	"733723": "Itata. .......",
	"733724": "This ...... insane young lady is .......",
	"733725": "What did you say?",
	"733726": "Nah, I didn't say anything!",
	"733727": "Look, your stomach looks fine, let's go out to eat together.",
	"733728": "What? But ...... this time of day, the cafeteria will be crowded ...... and I'm not ...... that .......",
	"733729": "Good grief!",
	"733730": "Wow!",
	"733731": "Tiara is so light. It's as light as a kitten, so I can take it anywhere.",
	"733732": "Tsun tsun...... sure it is. It's kind of fuzzy and ...... I've never had a pet before, so--",
	"733733": "Let me hold her!",
	"733734": "Mmmmmm!",
	"733735": "It seems that when Laniat holds me in her arms, she rejects me.",
	"733736": "How can I make it work? ......",
	"733737": "Anyway, let's go to the diner!",
	"733738": "It is still crowded.",
	"733739": "It's lunchtime! But look, there are empty seats.",
	"733740": "There are people over there ...... and over here ...... and everywhere ....... Karin. Don't ever leave my side.",
	"733741": "Now, let's go look at the menu--",
	"733742": "Wait a minute--",
	"733743": "Beware!",
	"733744": "Do you want to go too Tiara?",
	"733745": "No, I'm not going ....... Because, you know, where there's a ...... line, there's a lot of people. ......",
	"733746": "Then what would you like to eat? I'll go order for you.",
	"733747": "Burgers and ...... cold cozies.",
	"733748": "I deduce that.\"",
	"733749": "I see. .......\"",
	"733750": "I understand.",
	"733751": "Eh, Arkria!",
	"733752": "Hello. You are looking well today.",
	"733753": "Arkria, where have you been since early in the morning? We looked for you all over the school, but we couldn't find you at all.",
	"733754": "I was preparing for what could happen in the future.",
	"733755": "Preparation?",
	"733756": "It's a long story to explain. Besides, Karin will figure it out eventually.",
	"733757": "I see. Let's get hungry first. Tiara, here's your hamburger set.",
	"733758": "Oh, thanks, .......",
	"733759": "I ordered a hamburger too. What did Laniat order?",
	"733760": "This way, please.",
	"733761": "Oh, it's just a regular onigiri. I thought you were going to eat caviar and foie gras with diamonds.",
	"733762": "You don't sell that stuff in the cafeteria. ......",
	"733763": "Me, I have decided to try a variety of common people's food. If I get used to them now, I won't have any trouble if I have to throw myself into the fray.",
	"733764": "Yeah, yeah, that's a good mindset.",
	"733765": "I'll take it -- hummmm .......",
	"733766": "Mogmogu, the taste is still quite bland, but ...... Hahummmm. Anho wa gan mari......... keho keho! Ugh......!",
	"733767": "Are you okay? Drink some water quickly--!",
	"733768": "That's my cohort!",
	"733770": "Phew. ......The meal of the common man is a tough one. ......",
	"733771": "Arkria is eating ...... ramen?",
	"733772": "Yes.",
	"733773": "Wow, that's a little unexpected. But looking at it makes me want to eat it too.",
	"733774": "Yes. Want to try some?",
	"733775": "Are you sure?",
	"733776": "Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo",
	"733777": "I see, ramen noodles are eaten by putting the noodles together with chopsticks and putting them on a bamboo stick. I learned a lot.",
	"733778": "Hm!",
	"733780": "............",
	"733781": "........................",
	"733782": "Spicy!",
	"733783": "Water--water--water! Oh, just drink the soup--",
	"733784": "Geez, it's even more painful--!",
	"733785": "Go! Go, my 00ra!",
	"733786": "Goggle Goggle .......",
	"733787": "Hah ...... thanks for the help ...... soda banzai .......",
	"733788": "Arkria doesn't mind eating such spicy food ...... and she's already finished it!",
	"733789": "I'm all about efficiency when it comes to eating. This is no big deal.",
	"733790": "So much pain!",
	"733791": "Spicy?",
	"733792": "Oh my, this ramen is spicy.",
	"733793": "I didn't know that. ......",
	"733794": "Kuuuhhhh. .............",
	"733795": "Laniat?",
	"733796": "What ...... but no ...... .......",
	"733797": "She sneaked a sip of soup.",
	"733798": "Even though we know it's super spicy ramen?",
	"733799": "Because you hate to lose, right? You're pathetic. ......",
	"733800": "You don't have to do that. ......",
	"733801": "I have found that bushido means to die.",
	"733802": "I am ...... large ...... length ...... husband ......... ....",
	"733803": "Tiara ...... it .......",
	"733804": "Goggle Goggle ......!",
	"733805": "Oh, I drank all the coke.",
	"733807": "I ran to the beverage counter.",
	"733809": "They came back very quickly.",
	"733810": "Gobble gobble gobble--!",
	"733811": "Ugh!",
	"733812": "Suddenly collapsed!",
	"733813": "Are you okay?",
	"733814": "I'll call Dr. Se.......",
	"733815": "No need. She'll be fine.",
	"733816": "It doesn't look like it, but--",
	"733817": "Let's look back at the sequence of events.",
	"733818": "What? Is that how it's going to turn out?",
	"733819": "Try to remember. What do you think the laniat who went to the beverage counter most likely purchased?",
	"733820": "Isn't that a cohort?",
	"733821": "But if it's a coke, the cup is red, right? It's down there, it's green. ......",
	"733822": "So, what about ...... Honkai 00 La?",
	"733823": "What is that .......",
	"733824": "Laniat would have asked for a drink that she could buy right away.",
	"733825": "I see. I'm back soon, so it's most likely just a pour-over drink.",
	"733826": "Yes, I did. And the waitress, seeing her impatience, hastily poured the drink and handed it to her.",
	"733827": "Arkria then picked up the cup and read the label with the identity of the drink that had defeated Laniat.",
	"733828": "Bitter melon juice.",
	"733829": "That's funny. I'll take a picture.",
	"733830": "Why are they selling bitter melon juice in the cafeteria? Who would drink such a thing?",
	"733831": "I wouldn't drink it even if I was dead. ......",
	"733832": "Everyone has their own tastes. You can't explain it with logic.",
	"733835": "Phew~ satisfied satisfied satisfied~......that was delicious!",
	"733836": "How can you be satisfied with such ...... ubiquitous food?",
	"733837": "Your mouth still hurts, right? You didn't have to force yourself to talk. ......",
	"733838": "What time is it now? ...... Oh, it's already past 1:00.",
	"733839": "What do we do now?",
	"733840": "Back to the dorm, one choice.",
	"733841": "I have no particular opinion of ....... ......",
	"733842": "Ummm......... there's nothing to do in school right now.",
	"733843": "We haven't finished recruiting students, so the entrance exam is still a long way off.",
	"733844": "It looks like I won't be able to take classes until after the exams are over. ......",
	"733845": "The internet was no good at all!",
	"733846": "I'm dying of boredom!",
	"733847": "I'm going to go to the Long Sky City.",
	"733848": "What, are you going outside the school?",
	"733849": "--Oh, you're going to buy daily necessities for the dorm, aren't you?",
	"733850": "Yes, I did. I thought some of you might not know what it's like to live in a dormitory group, so I made a list for your reference.",
	"733851": "Mops, dishwashing detergent, brooms. ......",
	"733852": "I've seen this in a movie too. I think it was a tool used for cooking at .......",
	"733853": "Laniat, you're not blurting it out on purpose, are you?",
	"733854": "Yes, household items are important, but can I go buy a phone first? It's not convenient for keeping in touch, you know.",
	"733855": "This this this~! It's a necessity for modern kids~!",
	"733856": "But I'll run out of money soon. ...... ehhhh.",
	"733857": "Well, let's leave it at that!",
	"733858": "Is something wrong?",
	"733859": "...... you're calling me too - wow, don't pull that!",
	"733860": "Kasha.",
	"733861": "I'll let this picture be my phone background...................",
	"733863": "Alright then, let's get to shopping!",
	"733864": "I can buy something else besides daily necessities if it looks interesting, right?",
	"733865": "Oh? There he is: .......",
	"733867": "You're a purification committee member. I think he's standing guard.",
	"733868": "The purification committee is, as I recall, an agency specific to the city of Long Sky and not strictly a police force.",
	"733869": "I believe I heard that it is an organization that covers tourist guides, city management, and even military functions.",
	"733870": "The cleanup committee has expanded its responsibility to \"protect the appearance of the city\" to include a whole host of activities.",
	"733871": "I wonder. Why not create a specialized police force?",
	"733872": "Good question. First, this long-empty city is practically under the power of the Confederation of the Southern Continent.",
	"733873": "There has always been a principle here that \"stigmata users are prohibited from engaging in police work,\" but I guess the most important reason is that a purification committee would not be subject to that regulation.",
	"733874": "Wow, that's great.",
	"733875": "The size of the purification committee is very large, but there are only a few outstanding people. Most of them are just ordinary people in charge of traffic management and sightseeing.",
	"733876": "When I said \"amazing,\" I meant Arkria, because she knows it like an encyclopedia. Because I know it like an encyclopedia.",
	"733877": "You give too much praise for something like this.",
	"733878": "Wow, it's the military guys!",
	"733879": "Don't be in such a hurry. It's daytime now.",
	"733880": "It's quite normal to see Confederate soldiers in Changkuu City. They must be on vacation or something.",
	"733881": "Yes. This is nominally a territory of the Confederation of the Southern Continent.",
	"733882": "As long as you're not carrying a weapon, no one is going to say anything about the Confederate Soldiers of the Confederacy.",
	"733883": "Karin。",
	"733884": "What? What's wrong all of a sudden?",
	"733885": "I'm a little curious, so let me ask you this: you've always been in need of money, right?",
	"733886": "I think you were working in special transportation. ...... In other words, you are a bounty hunter.",
	"733887": "No, no, no, he's just a courier.",
	"733888": "--At any rate, I have heard that the remuneration setting for that type of work is high.",
	"733889": "If that's the case, I'm sure it can be explained by looking at the way Karin spends her money at .......",
	"733890": "How do you spend your money: ......?",
	"733891": "What is this penguin? It's super cute!",
	"733892": "This is a sandbag in the shape of a penguin, and you can hit it as much as you like.",
	"733893": "How can you be such a sandbag when you're so cute?",
	"733894": "Here, here~.",
	"733895": "How you sound like you've been hit. ......",
	"733896": "I don't know about you, but ...... I feel like punching you too.",
	"733897": "Ha!",
	"733898": "Hore hore - hore hore!",
	"733899": "You got hit and floated in the air!",
	"733900": "Buchi!",
	"733901": "There, there, there!",
	"733902": "I love the way you hit me. Clerk, give me this!",
	"733903": "The price will be 90,000 yen including tax.",
	"733904": "High!",
	"733905": "Isn't it very hard to carry such a big sandbag home?",
	"733906": "But I think I know what Arkria was trying to say ...... me.",
	"733907": "That's what I mean.",
	"733908": "If you miss it, it might just disappear from there, right? There's a saying, \"Once in a lifetime encounter. You have to cherish your relationships.",
	"733909": "This is a completely wasteful way of saying that. ......",
	"733910": "Please let me have a few whacks at it when it arrives at the dorm.",
	"733911": "of course",
	"733912": "It's going away. ......",
	"733913": "All right, all right~. Let's go to the next restaurant then!",
	"733914": "Purification Committee. Please clear the way.",
	"733915": "Another purification committee, what is it this time? ......",
	"733916": "Wow, it looks like a murder case: ...... Is it always like this in Chang Kuai City?",
	"733917": "Are any of the four of us from Chang Ku City?",
	"733918": "I don't see you at .......",
	"733919": "I've been going through the publicly available data, and it seems that just at the beginning of the school year, there tends to be an increase in violent incidents in the city of Nagora.",
	"733920": "Ahahaha............ because people like us are enrolling?",
	"733921": "That's not the case. It's because there will be fewer guards.",
	"733922": "What?",
	"733923": "Honkai Academy has introduced a practical off-campus program, and the teacher in charge often asks the purification committee to host students. Practical training partnerships usually take place around mid-semester or mid-semester.",
	"733924": "Every year, after the recess period is over and it's time for new students to come in, the students who had been practicing with the purification committee return to the academy.",
	"733925": "And that new students are going to practice, but where inexperienced students are policed, they will be temporarily less able to function.",
	"733926": "So that's what you meant ......, which means we may be part of the cleanup committee's crackdown in the future. ......",
	"733927": "Wow, I wouldn't have come if I knew ...... that they could make you do that. ......",
	"733928": "Yeah, I'd love to wear that uniform! Because it's so cool! And I'd love to see Arkria in her uniform, too.",
	"733929": "I wonder if it will look good on me.",
	"733930": "It definitely looks good on you!",
	"733931": "But if I had a choice, I would want to work on a case. It's super boring to just stand guard.",
	"733932": "How about Arkria? Do you have a job you'd like to do?",
	"733933": "Me?",
	"733934": "If nothing in particular, I absolutely hate this! Are there any jobs that you would hate to do?",
	"733935": "......I'd prefer not to work as an orderly, if I may say so.",
	"733936": "What do you want to do, Laniat?",
	"733937": "Detective.",
	"733938": "I want your mother to see me on the Internet as I drive my car at breakneck speeds, gracefully holding my gun at the ready. I am sure she will say, \"Well done, Raniat. \"Well done, Raniat.",
	"733939": "Yes, yes, yes. Let's start with getting a driver's license.",
	"733940": "If it were any other job, ...... traffic control would be boring and not for me. I guess I'd have to be a detective here.",
	"733941": "Yes, yes, yes! So, what about Tiara? Do you have any jobs you'd like to try?",
	"733942": "What, you're going to ask me too?",
	"733944": "I don't want to do anything, right?",
	"733945": "(Nodding)",
	"733946": "Indeed.",
	"733947": "I want to be in a dormitory with the air conditioning blowing. I want to make more money with money. ......",
	"733948": "(Nodding)",
	"733949": "You have a point.",
	"733950": "So, is there any job in particular that you don't like?",
	"733952": "All the things you have to talk to people about.",
	"733953": "(Nodding)",
	"733954": "Well, yes.",
	"733955": "Was this a ...... maid cafe?",
	"733956": "............ yeah ............ okay... ....",
	"733957": "What's wrong?",
	"733958": "My family's finances are on fire, so I think I'll come work here sometime.",
	"733959": "Are you a maid? ...... I know some things about maids.",
	"733960": "It's a profession that requires a thin-skinned speaking style and sometimes twisted mannerisms.",
	"733961": "That doesn't sound like a maid at all! It's more like a queen or something. ......",
	"733962": "No, we are talking about a real maid in the service of the Gordian family. But I am sure it varies from person to person.",
	"733963": "Oh, by the way, Arkria, is part-time work allowed by the school?",
	"733964": "I'm also looking into part-time work. They say it's allowed.",
	"733965": "How do you know so and everything?",
	"733966": "Oh, yeah. It's still under construction right now, so I'll come back when things settle down.",
	"733967": "Maid cafes, huh? I love maid cafes! I've never worn a maid's uniform before.",
	"733968": "~~~♪",
	"733970": "They all look so good, I can't decide! Okay, let's try this one!",
	"733971": "Karin。",
	"733972": "What?",
	"733973": "When you think of high school girls, you think of them with bread in their mouths, right?",
	"733974": "Where the hell did you get that knowledge?",
	"733975": "Uu............ u.............",
	"733976": "What are you scurrying about for? Are you looking for the restroom?",
	"733977": "Please give me two carbonated juices.",
	"733978": "Yes~yes.",
	"733980": "Go ahead~!",
	"733981": "Yes.",
	"733982": "Ugh ...... yeah ...... thanks .......",
	"733983": "(I wanted to drink the juice, but couldn't bring myself to say it because I wasn't sure if everyone would wait for me?)",
	"733984": "Wait here.",
	"733986": "Here you go.",
	"733987": "What book did you buy? Tidbits of Living in the City of the Long Sky? Wow, I thought Arkria would know everything without this kind of thing.",
	"733988": "Yes, I did. I bought three copies.",
	"733989": "Now, finally, let's buy the necessities of life!",
	"733992": "And then there's toilet paper.",
	"733993": "I bought it!",
	"733994": "Thank you. Now I have everything I wrote out.",
	"733995": "Hehehe~. I bought a lot of stuff that wasn't on the list!",
	"733996": "Your purchase of a \"god device for dormitory life\" is quite interesting. For example, a light that glows on impact in the shape of a grenade. ......",
	"733997": "Is a dormitory really such a dangerous place?",
	"733998": "Karin, I bet you will regret buying it tomorrow morning.",
	"733999": "That's not true! Since I get to go to school, I want to experience all the elements of youth.",
	"734000": "And that includes regret.",
	"734001": "Now that we're done shopping, let's go back to the dorm.",
	"734002": "Yes, it is. It's already evening, and it's almost time for dinner.",
	"734003": "Are you listening? ...... Arkria?",
	"734004": "Yes, .......",
	"734005": "...... I think we could have a dinner out today to get to know each other as roommates.",
	"734006": "Eating out. ...... No no no. I don't have that kind of money anymore.",
	"734007": "Tiara says it's on the house.",
	"734008": "Eh?",
	"734009": "Are you sure?",
	"734010": "He wants to thank everyone for their help yesterday.",
	"734011": "I know, right, Tiara?",
	"734012": "What? Ah!",
	"734013": "(Nodding)",
	"734014": "So he wants to treat everyone.",
	"734015": "But Tiara, are you sure you can handle it?",
	"734016": "Its .......",
	"734017": "Tiara says, \"Don't worry, it's no big deal if it's for the friendship with everyone in the dorm.\" ......",
	"734018": "I know, right, Tiara?",
	"734019": "(Nodding)",
	"734020": "It's like ventriloquism. ......",
	"734021": "Friendship. ......! I certainly received your sentiments!",
	"734022": "I, Laniat, will definitely respond to your feelings...",
	"734023": "Ugh!",
	"734024": "That is one heck of a spirited hug.",
	"734025": "Stop! You're hurting me! I'm losing!",
	"734027": "Hah ...... hah ...... hah ...... hah ...... this ...... big rich lady! .......",
	"734028": "Let's go.",
	"734029": "Huh? This is the restaurant we came to yesterday, right?",
	"734030": "Nouvelle Cuisine\" ......The last time I ordered takeout, it didn't feel at all like the new cuisine that is being put forth.",
	"734031": "Which one is ...... a hot pot with a barbecue on top and milk tea poured in the middle. ...... what's this?",
	"734032": "Aren't you just mixing up popular dishes?",
	"734033": "They haven't gone out of business, so the taste can't be that bad, right? So why do they need to do such a bizarre service?",
	"734034": "The restaurant industry is like a competitive, ruthless battlefield.",
	"734035": "Good evening~!",
	"734036": "There are four of you. Please come to any available seat.",
	"734037": "I'll definitely ...... get the ...... original!",
	"734038": "Let's taste every dish anyway: ...... yeah?",
	"734040": "Hey, I think I've seen this guy dressed somewhere ....... And his eyes are kind of scary.",
	"734041": "May I order one of those, Mr. Storekeeper? One of those and--",
	"734042": "Hmmm... ...... Well, that's okay--",
	"734043": "Speaking of which, I thought of you when I came to this store: .......",
	"734044": "I wonder if ...... was okay after all that ruckus yesterday?",
	"734045": "It was late in the day, and we were very careful to avoid casualties.",
	"734046": "Karin is referring to the repair bill.",
	"734047": "We had no choice but to destroy a lot of things to save our own lives. --You're not going to charge us for repairs, are you?",
	"734048": "Repair bills? ...... should be fine.",
	"734049": "Tiara, what do you know?",
	"734050": "Yeah. I told you about the Internet this morning, right? So I went to the school's message board and found a post saying that the school would be liable for any vandalism done by students on duty or for emergency evacuation.",
	"734051": "Wow, they even do that.",
	"734052": "Honkai Academy is funded by the taxes they collect on transfers from the four major cities, so they have plenty of money to spare.",
	"734053": "It's not an exaggeration to say that practically the entire world pays taxes to the academy.",
	"734054": "I see. I think I heard something like that somewhere too. But, I understand that the school is rich, but no one complains?",
	"734055": "I wouldn't say. The value brought by the eternal anchor is too great.",
	"734056": "Arkria tilted her head slightly.",
	"734057": "I followed Arkria's gaze and looked out the window further up the skyscraper.",
	"734058": "There, larger than anything else, was the \"Eternal Anchor,\" a transfer device that quietly glowed.",
	"734059": "It was like a sword thrust into the world.",
	"734060": "A permanent anchor can be transported to the location of another permanent anchor. That's why the new Changkuu City is also called the Transfer City.",
	"734061": "If it weren't for the eternal anchor, the four transfer cities would be no different than any other ordinary city.",
	"734062": "And the academy is said to hold the transfer technology and can turn the device on and off at will.",
	"734063": "I have heard that ...... Dr. Estherine Liebtruth was in charge of the development and manufacturing of this weapon to save this world, which was deployed by Houraiji Kyuushou, the school's president, himself.",
	"734064": "If the eternal anchor had not existed, this world would have been swallowed up by the mortal realm long ago.",
	"734065": "The Honkai Academy, which has thus created a new order, is qualified and powerful enough to collect taxes from the entire world.",
	"734066": "Hmmm... .......",
	"734067": "I was relieved to hear that~. Because we did it for self-preservation, right?",
	"734068": "The food is ready. Please take your time.",
	"734070": "It looks weird, but it's ...... pretty tasty!",
	"734071": "Its .......",

	"734269": "If the standard equipment isn't enough for you, you have to earn your own money.",
	"734270": "So they raise funds by building workshops, doing homebrewing, promoting military companies, and in some cases, idolizing them.",
	"734271": "Weapons were that expensive. ......",

	"734499": "It can't be helped. If you make exceptions, you will eventually have to grant them all. Besides, it's the maximum concession we can make to have them work for the city administration instead of paying back the money.",

	"734506": "Oh, by the way, how are ...... entrance exam scores determined?",

	"734508": "What?",
	"734509": "I wonder if you remember the material I asked you for at lunch?",
	"734510": "Documentation? Oh, ......, that's what you mean. Arkria told me to check out the admissions posts and documents for the past two years.",
	"734511": "Let's see, ...... put it all together ...... briefly ...... uh, .......",
	"734512": "Here, take a deep breath. Then you don't have to choose your words so thoughtfully, just say what you think.",
	"734513": "Yeah ...... that, I mean, first of all ...... and then .......",
	"734514": "The school's entrance examinations are designed to make students work hard, and they cannot be expelled if they finish in the bottom half of the standings. But those who do are restricted in their behavior in the first year and have to undergo intensive training in isolation in the academy.",
	"734515": "The key score is the total of the three areas, and the distribution of points is 50% for actual competition, 30% for general knowledge, and 20% for morale.",
	"734516": "50% for actual competition, huh? No wonder the battle maniacs put so much emphasis on the entrance exam.",
	"734517": "The order of the exam is ...... first the general knowledge, then the actual exam.",
	"734518": "...... maybe you don't want to get injured in a real battle and affect the written exam?",
	"734519": "............ This is about all I know: .......",
	"734520": "Hmmm... ...... I'm not quite sure what exactly I should do from now on...",
	"734521": "I don't know either. ...... I've done nothing more than calculate the test results that were posted and predict the weighting for each test. ......",
	"734522": "It's okay! Tiara, you did well enough~! All right, all right~!",
	"734523": "Wow!",
	"734524": "That's great, great, great! By the way, how much money does Laniat have left?",
	"734525": "We can make a little money by selling some of the things we don't need.",
	"734526": "What are the specifics?",
	"734527": "It would be about 2 million.",
	"734528": "to <size=50>2 million! That's how much there is! </size>",
	"734529": "But good. Then I guess we can raise the original funds if we all pitch in.",
	"734530": "You bet the money raised, right? So who should you bet on?",
	"734531": "I don't have to ask that, do I?",
	"734532": "What?",
	"734533": "Oh ...... don't. I asked a question that made no sense to me.",
	"734534": "Of course, we bet on ourselves.",
	"734535": "That makes the most sense. But first, you'd have to qualify for the bet.",
	"734536": "Oh yeah. I can't even make a statement until I get to level 5. ...... How much experience does it take to get to level 5?",
	"734537": "It seems like you're not even close to having normal access every day. ...... If you take it easy, by the time you get to level 5, the exam will be over. ......",
	"734538": "Ummm...if we don't even qualify to speak at ............, then this plan of ours won't work at all to begin with.",
	"734539": "So, the first thing you have to do is--",
	"734540": "You have to stick to the board and accumulate experience.",
	"734541": "Well, then, the four of us join forces to quadruple--",
	"734542": "Let's work with Tiara to save experience!",
	"734545": "Next day.",
	"734546": "It's done!",
	"734547": "Did you see the results?",
	"734548": "Yup! There's no doubt about it. ...... No, there should be no doubt about it. ......",
	"734549": "Hearing Tiara's fuss, everyone gathered in the living room.",

	"734554": "The app automatically adds points to your score when you engage in behavior that is judged to be \"high moral character.\"",
	"734555": "All we have to do is write and increase our experience, right? What does this have to do with moral scores?",
	"734556": "Because we don't have much time left. We need to get the scores we need ready early if we're going to be a dark horse.",
	"734557": "The moral score is a numerical value to facilitate the evaluation of whether students are well-behaved or not. And it is the only one of the three areas that is scored even before the exam is administered.",
	"734558": "Does that mean I have to do something useful for someone else?",
	"734559": "Yes, I know. But I guess I'm killing two birds with one stone, since the content that is posted on a particular forum is supposed to be \"useful\" to that \"someone\".",
	"734560": "I see. You can't help people in need unless they are in need, but a message board is also a place where people in need gather.",
	"734561": "Yeah, yeah, I understand it all! I'm going to try to get up to the level of the board and get a perfect moral score by the time I take the test! Let's all do our best -- aye-aye!",

	"734659": "Which is ...... Basically, it's a system where you do stuff offline and then come back here and report back and get experience.",
	"734660": "You still hadn't resolved the bulletin board sweepstakes!",
	"734661": "Here I am! I'll take my reward then!",
	"734662": "Oh, this has been resolved. Do you want to look back again?",
	"734663": "Huh, ...... has been getting too many ads lately.",
	"734664": "Wouldn't you like some experience? We get more people advertising at the beginning of the fiscal year. Could you help us remove unnecessary advertisements?",
	"734665": "Have you completed the process? Thank you for your contribution to this forum.",
	"734666": "Hmmm... ......The ads that young people make these days are just shoddy. ......",
	"734667": "Hey there newbies, you want some experience? Help me put up an ad. It would be good for all of our students.",
	"734668": "Done? Kukuk, you janitors, let's see if you can deal with my newly developed pop-up ads!",
	"734669": "Please select a difficulty level",

	"734671": "3rd ......0 min 42 sec (reality) 2nd ......1 min 01 sec (reality) 1st ......6 min 59 sec (reality)",
	"734672": "The gap between first and second place is quite wide.",
	"734673": "And the longer the time, the higher the ranking? That makes sense. Maybe no one has been able to clear the difficulty level of \"reality,\" and it is recorded who has endured the longest.",
	"734674": "Let's take a look at the name: ....... Oh, it's a ......4 people team. The username is \"Dandelion Team\" and the record was last updated 3 years ago.",
	"734675": "All you have to do is defeat the baddies, right? Let's take them down quickly and easily!",
	"734676": "Yakisoba bread from the cafeteria, huh? If you're asking for it, it's definitely the one that's being fought over, right? Okay, let's get fired up! The target is yakisoba bread--!",
	"734677": "Cat, ...... I'm pretty sure it was a gray cat. ...... What do you like to do?",
	"734678": "I finally caught you ...... just in time - no, no, no, no, don't run away - no, don't run away!",
	"734679": "At least you got him. You still have some time left - hey, don't run away!",
	"734680": "That was easy to catch. Plenty of time left--what's going on? Oh, my God! Don't run away--",
	"734681": "You managed it. Let's go to ...... to report.",
	"734682": "Something like this? Well then, let's go to the report.",
	"734683": "Wow, that's perfect! Let's go report it right away!",
	"734684": "You managed it. Let's go to ...... to report.",

	"734693": "I met a girl here yesterday and it was love at first sight.",
	"734694": "Wow. What's he like?",
	"734695": "What can I say? She's bright, passionate, and smiles like a hooch all the time.",
	"734696": "Is that what you call bright?",
	"734697": "I wonder if that child will come here today.",
	"734698": "Ugh! Sis! Are you really going to do that?",
	"734699": "That's right. They're going to use a discoloring chemical to tattoo the underground structure of Changkuo City on your back.",
	"734700": "But, the headmaster!",
	"734701": "Look closely. It's a cosplayer.",
	"734702": "Let's go quickly, it would be bad if it shows up on ...... distribution or something. ......",
	"734703": "............ Karin. I just realized that I forgot to write one of my secret reports. I am sorry, but could you please take it off? It's a military matter, after all. Ohohohohoho .......",

	"734705": "It is not executable. Its difficulty has not yet been released.",
	"734706": "Perhaps because it had been living with the Stigmata for so long, the cat was quicker than I had imagined, and while I was distracted by something else for a moment, it ran away and ran through the grass toward the station.",
	"734707": "I desperately followed the cat and arrived at the station. I followed the cat into the car and searched around the car.",
	"734708": "Then we got to ...... long sky city, but still could not find it.",
	"734709": "You'll just have to keep looking for ....... ......",
	"734710": "I didn't get the canine badge ...... nor the rabbit badge ...... and I didn't get the feline badge this time either .......",
	"734711": "Oh, you're the junior girl, aren't you? Are you going to the cafeteria? Oh, those roses on the ground are our lab plants gone wild. Construction kids are capable of all kinds of things, but you'll get used to it.",
	"734712": "............ Oh? Are you giving me a cat badge?",
	"734713": "I'm glad! Well then, here's a thank you. Just a little dab of herbicide and ...... it'll be gone in the blink of an eye.",
	"734714": "I want a frog badge. But I can only eat meat buns. I'm stuck. ......",
	"734715": "Oh, what are you doing here? What? Are you going to give me a frog badge? Thanks~.",
	"734716": "You want to buy some yakisoba bread? Then I, a senior, have a better idea. Keep your eyes open and watch closely - the power of brains - and you'll see what I'm talking about!",
	"734717": "Ha. --------!",
	"734718": "I felt the sky and the ground spinning around. It seemed I had been sent to the entrance of the cafeteria by a senior.",
	"734719": "Pippi Pippi ...... Pippi Pippi .......",
	"734720": "I woke up!",
	"734721": "Good morning.",
	"734722": "When I woke up, Arkria was sitting by my bed.",
	"734723": "Oh, Arkria.",
	"734724": "Today is exam day, right?",
	"734725": "Yes. In the morning is the general knowledge exam. In the afternoon, you'll be grouped into groups for the practical exam, which starts tomorrow.",
	"734726": "What about those two?",
	"734727": "Laniat said she's going directly to the exam site after her morning workout. Tiara said she's going there after the games have consumed her energy.",
	"734728": "Oh, yeah--",
	"734729": "I flipped the futon.",
	"734730": "Okay, let's go take the test!",
	"734731": "I'm pretty sure the school's application said the venue was on the basement floor of .......",
	"734732": "Everyone seems to be in different rooms for the exam.",
	"734733": "We need to start ...... making our abilities look low.",
	"734734": "Karin Meride, right?",
	"734735": "This is room B102, right ......?",
	"734736": "Just answer yes or no. Do you have a student ID card?",
	"734737": "I brought it.",
	"734738": "Your ID has been verified. I am Irma Ingrid, Senior Teacher in the Department of Tactics, and I am your examiner for this exam.",
	"734739": "Time is limited, so we'll get started right away.",
	"734740": "Huh?",
	"734741": "First issue. In the period before the Aftermath War, there existed a secret military organization called Schicksal, and within that organization there existed a position called \"Saintess\". Name one of the saints of that Schicksal.",
	"734742": "Oh, wait. You're going to answer orally and directly? Not just handed out like an answer sheet?",
	"734743": "...... You each have various unexplained abilities. To prevent you from using them to cheat, we, your teachers, will be watching you one-on-one and making sure that you are tested in this way.",
	"734744": "So, okay, don't look elsewhere or scurry around, just look me in the eye and answer the questions I give you.",
	"734745": "Before I go any further, I'd like to warn you not to cheat by any means. That very smart-looking roommate of yours, ......, Akria Hroptr, right? There are 13 probes of Honkai energy in Room 203 where she is taking the exam, and they are watching her to make sure she is not using her abilities.",
	"734746": "Even if she tries to tell you the answer in some way, you can still get it from .......",
	"734747": "I'll detect it immediately and take the appropriate measures.",
	"734748": "I mean, as long as they don't find it?",
	"734749": "Don't just think about cheating like that. We don't have time for this.",
	"734750": "Oh, sure. Yes. Let's see, .......",
	"734751": "(The person who was the Schicksal saint was ...... Schicksal ...... Schicksal ...... I'm pretty sure I've seen that name before in a phone game. Yes, the answer is--)",
	"734752": "Incorrect.",
	"734753": "Eh? The name you just mentioned, it definitely had something to do with Schicksal, didn't it?",
	"734754": "He is the longest-serving and most well-known archbishop in the history of Schicksal. There are many rumors about him, and a good portion of them are true.",
	"734755": "Is it possible, then, that the rumor that he was actually a woman was true?",
	"734756": "That will never happen. Yes, point deduction.",
	"734757": "Ugh!",
	"734758": "Incorrect.",
	"734759": "Eh? That's funny. Saint, I thought her name was Kasrana. ......",
	"734760": "That man is the father of prominent Honkai hero Kiana Kasrana. And you can find him at .......",
	"734761": "Do you think it's possible to have a saint by the name of Siegfried?",
	"734762": "Because all the female characters in the games I play have masculine names, and ...... he has the last name Kasrana.",
	"734763": "If the Kasrana family were all women, how could they have passed down the family name from generation to generation? Point deducted.",
	"734764": "Ugh!",
	"734765": "Maybe you did it on purpose?",
	"734766": "Eh, ............ yeah, I just remembered this name suddenly.",
	"734767": "It's the president of M.E. Corporation, one of the enforcers of the secret military society Anti-Entropy. He went missing during the Aftermath War.",
	"734768": "That's right. You are very knowledgeable, doctor.",
	"734769": "That's the basics.",
	"734770": "No, no, no, no, no. You know a lot of things, doctor, and it's really great.",
	"734771": "Yes, point deduction.",
	"734772": "Ugh! No sesame seeds either? .......",
	"734773": "I really wonder where in the world such an answer would come from.",
	"734774": "Because the person is a woman,...... and she seems very famous,...... and all the other answers I can think of seem to be male,.......",
	"734775": "Incorrect. That person is a former director of Jinki-ren Shinshu and has basically nothing to do with Schicksal.",
	"734776": "And he's a man.",
	"734777": "No way!",
	"734778": "Yes, if you're done being surprised, keep answering. Now that's another point deduction.",
	"734779": "Ugh!",
	"734780": "Next question. It is a fact known to all that the greatest invention made by mankind since the Aftermath War is the implant, an implant that mimics the sacral structure.",
	"734781": "Yeah, yeah, you have a teacher, don't you?",
	"734782": "Yes, I do. I can discipline students who are not good listeners because of it - here's the question. Who developed the world's first implant?",
	"734783": "Ugh. ...................",
	"734784": "(That's ...... anyway, as I recall, he was a great guy. .............)",
	"734785": "Incorrect. But well, you could answer that.",
	"734786": "Rumors that the implants were developed by Dr. Liebtruth have been all over the Internet for more than a few decades.",
	"734787": "But not really?",
	"734788": "Yes. Various historical documents prove that the world's first implant was invented by Charisma Sunderland, former head of the First Legion and once called the \"Commander of Mankind.",
	"734789": "The fact that this technology appeared so suddenly, without any evidence to support it, has given rise to all sorts of conspiracy theories.",
	"734790": "Yes, yes, exactly. That's why it won't be incorrect this time: .......",
	"734791": "Point deduction.",
	"734792": "Ugh!",
	"734793": "Incorrect. But oh well, it's close.",
	"734794": "There are a lot of people who describe Ryan Kumaré, the head of the Legion of the East, as the smartest person in the world. But that doesn't mean that every important invention was created by him.",
	"734795": "It's true that he's a genius when it comes to achieving standardization in implant manufacturing, and it's also true that it's because of the power of the industrial groups under his umbrella that he's been able to do so. But he did not invent them.",
	"734796": "Wasn't it Ryan Kumaré?",
	"734797": "Yes. The correct answer is Charisma Sunderland, former commander of the First Corps. Deduct points.",
	"734798": "Ugh!",
	"734799": "............ Are you being serious?",
	"734800": "Because ...... she's an amazing person and I thought ...... she could do anything.",
	"734801": "Indeed, Kiana Kasrana's whereabouts have remained unknown for a long time.",
	"734802": "Rumor has it that she has no intention of intervening in the world's current conflicts and is currently traveling the world at a loose end.",
	"734803": "No wonder her name is on the list of possible inventors in terms of ability.",
	"734804": "But unfortunately, the widely accepted academic view is that Charisma Sunderland, former head of the First Legion and Commander of Mankind in all but name, is the inventor of the implant.",
	"734805": "Charisma, you mean that demon that caused the civil war of mankind?",
	"734806": "In a way, people who cause startling evils have some kind of talent. Point deduction.",
	"734807": "Siksik!",
	"734808": "Incorrect. The marshal's accomplishments are primarily in the military. The correct answer is Charisma Sunderland, former head of the First Corps.",
	"734809": "Marshal?",
	"734810": "...... Speaking of which, Dr.--",
	"734811": "Oh, you know what?",
	"734812": "You do your research well. I have to give you guys a little credit.",
	"734813": "Before the great division of the Southern Legion, I was a hunter in the Central Army of the Southern Legion, and I was a lieutenant and a captain.",
	"734814": "Respect for the General is the only emotion that I can say is common among many people in the ...... corps.",
	"734815": "So, after the General's death, the teacher, he felt that there was no point in staying in the military and decided to teach at the academy?",
	"734816": "The military is not a place where you can join if you want to and leave if you want to - I, no, let's not.",
	"734817": "Yes, point deduction.",
	"734818": "Siksik!",
	"734819": "Your grades are going to be very tight if you keep this up, ...... Meride.",
	"734820": "Sick Sick Sick Sick .......",
	"734821": "But I'm not going to be merciful here because of your future. Now for the next question--",
	"734822": "Explain the principle of operation of the void printer.",
	"734823": "Oh, I know that one! We throw the matter from our universe into another world, and when we do that, the Honkai energy in the other world floods into ours. ......",
	"734824": "And if you reverse it and send more Honkai energy, the matter will return, so you use that principle to print industrial products, right?",
	"734826": "Oh, no?",
	"734827": "That's a very unprofessional way of putting it, but ......, well, it's not wrong.",
	"734829": "Okay, then, on to the question related to that. Why couldn't mankind have used void printer technology prior to the aftermath wars?",
	"734830": "Isn't that because the will to Honkai used ...... Honkai energy to zombify humanity?",
	"734831": "There's another cause.",
	"734832": "Hmmm... ...................",
	"734833": "Well, you don't have to think so hard. This is not the content of the test. The reason is that there was no matter in the Honkai universe at that time.",
	"734834": "The willful overseer at the top of Honkai had the ability to turn matter into Honkai energy, something that mankind doesn't have.",
	"734835": "The supervisor of will had first converted all the matter in the Honkai universe into Honkai energy, so even if the real universe sent Honkai energy, there was no matter that could be acquired instead, and all that would come out would be Honkai energy.",
	"734836": "It connects worlds separated by walls and transforms matter into energy. And from that energy, we rebuild matter. These are the two most important principles that support the world we live in today.",
	"734837": "Remember.",
	"734838": "Yes, so much for the question-answer format.",
	"734839": "Finally finished ....... It was difficult.",
	"734840": "Karin, where are you going?",
	"734841": "What? Because, sir, you said it's over?",
	"734842": "What you've done is a question-answer format. Next, we'll move on to the subjective test.",
	"734843": "Yeah, yeah, yeah!",
	"734844": "Look at the topographical map projected on the blackboard. You are now at position Q3, where A9 and E9 each have a Confederation of the Southern Continent unit ...... i.e., a Confederation of the Southern Continent infantry platoon, and V5 has a small power plant .......",
	"734848": "Kinkong kankong. Kinkong kankong.",
	"734849": "Ugh ............ ah .............",
	"734850": "Yes, the exam is over. Karin, you did very poorly on the exam.",
	"734851": "I'm ...... how many points did I get?",
	"734852": "6.......",
	"734853": "Sixty how many points?",
	"734854": "Six points.",
	"734855": "Ugh!",
	"734856": "If you do poorly on the field test, too, you'll be restricted from your first semester of action and will be required to participate in quarantine-style reinforcement training.",
	"734857": "Wow, I'm going to be stuck in school for the entire first semester?",
	"734858": "That's right. And if you do, make sure you pick the proper classes for my military fundamentals and practical guerrilla warfare classes.",
	"734859": ".................. ha~yes......... ....",
	"734861": "You all finished your exams, right?",
	"734862": "(Let's go look for them.)",
	"734863": "Karin? Are you finished too?",
	"734864": "Were you waiting for me? Laniat finished first, didn't she?",
	"734865": "Naturally. Most of the students are already done. Karin is the slow one.",
	"734866": "Ugh...the problems that the ............ teacher gives me, I've never even heard of them. And I get stares from people who look at me like \"why don't you know these things?",
	"734867": "Ahhh, why am I not the protagonist of a game where I get amnesia as soon as it starts, and a beautiful, wise wife-type girl who is always around to teach me all the common sense I need to know.",
	"734868": "Pfft, that's him, right?\"",
	"734869": "Isn't she?\" You must be that cool looking princess knight.\"",
	"734870": "Hm? Laniat, you're kind of getting famous, aren't you?",
	"734871": "Hmph, it must be because I was the first to finish my answer. It's really hard to hide the dazzling radiance that radiates from me.",
	"734872": "He answered all the subjective tests, \"I'm going to charge into the main camp by myself and cut off the other boss's head. and she got into an argument with the teacher about the strength of the team. Kusukusukusu~!",
	"734873": "How does everyone know the status of our exam?",
	"734875": "'Isn't that the girl beside her, Karin, who thought she had finished the whole morning exam when the question-format questions were over?'",
	"734876": "Ugh...... let's get back to the dorms as soon as possible...... Speaking of which, where are Arkria and Tiara?",
	"734877": "Sorry to keep you waiting. I was just heading over to the senior dorms for a bit.",
	"734878": "I was there. Where's Tiara?",
	"734879": "Tiara is here.",
	"734880": "Here?",
	"734881": "Laniat pointed to a cardboard box at his feet.",
	"734882": "She just told me that her exam results were so good that she wanted to keep a low profile and hid in a cardboard box.",
	"734883": "I don't think you're even speechless in front of your teacher. ......",
	"734884": "Karin............。",
	"734885": "What?",
	"734886": "I don't want to go to ............ afternoon grouping ............ boku .......",
	"734887": "I have to go. You haven't forgotten our plan, have you?",
	"734888": "Uuuu.................. can you tell the doctor that I'm not feeling well?",
	"734889": "It's okay, Tiara. If you are not feeling well, rest in the cardboard box and I will carry you in the afternoon.",
	"734890": "I don't want to go......I'm sure everyone will be surrounding me and replaying the video of my exam over and over again......Ah! My abomination in the exam has already been picked up on the school's internet......oh I want to die already......I'll have to live with a paper bag over my head for the rest of my life!",
	"734891": "What is that cardboard box? It looks like it's rattling around on its own.\"",
	"734892": "Tiara, anyway, let's go back to the dorm once.",
	"734893": "Arkria......。",
	"734894": "People who constantly ridicule others usually consider themselves losers. Do you think you are a loser?",
	"734895": "Ugh. .......",
	"734896": "I can tell. You are not that kind of person. I can see you finally winning, paying off your debts, and not having to mascot.",
	"734897": "When that time comes, those who despise you now will realize that they were foolish.",
	"734898": "But if we give up before that happens, we're done with this.",
	"734900": "Bo...... me I'm going this afternoon too...... now I'm just ...... a little tired on my feet and legs.... ....",
	"734901": "Then I'll carry him for you.",
	"734902": ".............................. ......Thank you .......",
	"734903": "This is the venue for grouping.",
	"734904": "I overheard while I was at home that Honkai Academy places a great deal of emphasis on team unity.",
	"734905": "That's why they also include group cooperation as a test item in the initial examination immediately after admission.",
	"734906": "But why don't you divide the teams by ...... dorm room .......",
	"734907": "Dorm rooms are simply assigned based on the order in which you enter the school. So even if you have four roommates, in some cases, you may have the worst compatibility in terms of abilities and personalities.",
	"734908": "But even if you just use ............ the afternoon to group up, you'd still have to meet and talk with classmates you don't know at all....... If that's the case,............ it's totally better to work with your roommate,.......",
	"734909": "I'm not totally unaware of it.",
	"734910": "What?",
	"734911": "Because there are already quite a few more kids using the school's online bulletin board to look up information.",
	"734912": "Yeah ...... anyway! Let's each ...... show our classmates how good we are.",
	"734913": "Oh, here comes a very famous buffoon in the whole school.",
	"734914": "It's hurtful when a teacher says that.",
	"734915": "If you are going to get hurt, get hurt. This will help you feel more shame and motivate you.",
	"734916": "Siksik ...... I don't know if I can find a proper companion like this .......",
	"734917": "Do you know why no one wants to work with you?",
	"734918": "Hmm?",
	"734919": "That's because your attitude is so flippant.",
	"734920": "Everyone who enrolls in Honkai Academy does so in order to survive, or with a sense of honor or mission. In other words, they all have a clear sense of purpose.",
	"734921": "But you don't have that awareness. You feel that coming to the school is just part of the fun. People may not be that deeply aware of it, but I'm sure you subconsciously feel that you can't trust people like that.",
	"734922": "Is that the case with everyone? It doesn't seem that way from what I've seen.",
	"734923": "Yeah ............ there have certainly been some changes in the last two years, but I think the majority of people I just mentioned are still in the majority. ...... Maybe.",
	"734924": "I see. ...... By the way, doctor, I have a clear goal now.",
	"734925": "What?",
	"734926": "In the meantime, I'll take first place in the actual exam. What do you think?",
	"734927": "You're still so lighthearted.",
	"734928": "Oh, my God. Doctor, don't hit me on the head. You'll make me look like an idiot.",
	"734929": "Arkria, how's it going over there?",
	"734930": "Oh, you are Arkria, right?",
	"734932": "I heard you got a perfect score on your general knowledge exam. Our group needs people like you. What are your intentions?",
	"734934": "Yes, your intention. Your intention to join our group.",
	"734935": "You want to come in?",
	"734936": "Yes, to our group.",
	"734937": "We?",
	"734938": "It's ......, so it's the group you'll be working with tomorrow on the actual exam.",
	"734939": "Action?",
	"734940": "............It appears that Arkria is not interested in joining our group. I am sorry for taking up your time--what?",
	"734941": "Mr. Arkria, what is wrong with you, suddenly touching my hand?",
	"734942": "Your palm ............ is very distinctive.",
	"734943": "Palmistry, you know, represents a person's destiny.",
	"734944": "Do you know the legend of the Pulbaronians in the Perseus Nebula? That's where the secret to saving the world lies.",
	"734945": "Awww, I've got to go!",
	"734946": "Oh, was Arkria that kind of a radio personality?",
	"734947": "No, of course not. The way your voice sounded and the line you just said sounded so much like that, I almost thought so too.",
	"734948": "The stars show us the course of our destiny. When the time comes, the lizard people and the swan people will blow their horns first.",
	"734949": "A lizard's mouth can blow a horn ...... No, and a swan can't either!",
	"734950": "Are you Mr. Laniat?",
	"734951": "Raise your head. In front of you is the heir to the Gordian family, the holder of the Stigmata of the Double Spiral Profile, the commander of the battleship Eumenes, a marksman as gorgeous as a lily, and the man who lives in Room 213 of the H-1 student dormitory, and who will be on duty this Friday. --",
	"734952": "We are Laniat Gordias de Eumenes!",
	"734953": "Can I help you?",
	"734954": "I'm sorry ................... Our group doesn't have enough room to accommodate that many people. My apologies.",
	"734956": "Is that ...... Tiara?",
	"734958": "Are you talking to ............ that ...... me?",
	"734959": "Yes, it is. Um, I would like to ask you, Tiara, what is the power of your stigmata?",
	"734960": ".............................. It's a .................. secret. ......... ....",
	"734961": "If you do, would you be willing to practice with me in the vacant lot there and have a little hand-to-hand combat?",
	"734962": "Sorry! Did I do something bad to you guys? Are you going to drag me to the back alley and bully me? ...... I'll do anything! So just don't be violent ............!",
	"734963": "I, eh, um, ...... sorry, no more.",
	"734965": "Can I have a moment?",
	"734966": "Yeah? - Yeah. Hey there.",
	"734967": "You haven't found your people yet?",
	"734968": "Yeah.",
	"734969": "Then you can have a little chat with me.",
	"734970": "I am a Stigmata Recipient trained by the Southern Legion War Arbitration Commission. Yes, I am a member of what is often referred to as the Triple Alliance.",
	"734971": "I was in the top ten at my old military school!",
	"734972": "What? How can such a cute girl be even more amazing?",
	"734973": "It's ...... embarrassing to be cute. And you?",
	"734974": "I'm Karin.",
	"734975": "Karin？",
	"734976": "Hm? Wait ...... by any chance. I'll check it out. ......",
	"734978": "I'm sorry about that ....... I'm sorry, but I can't work with you to take the test because students who come here on a training contract from the military are screened for their grades.",
	"734979": "I'm very sorry ...... I'm really sorry!",
	"734980": "Don't worry about it. I'll look around some more.",
	"734981": "............ She's such a pretty girl. ...... It's such a waste. ......",
	"734982": "Hello?",
	"734983": "Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm just not sure what to do. I would love to team up with Karin, but my people are obsessed with grades. ......",
	"734984": "I haven't said anything yet.",
	"734985": "This girl looks like she's looking at her phone, doesn't she?",
	"734986": "Yay! The pink twin ponytailed child forcefully caught the blue drill head's outstretched hand without dodging.",
	"734987": "Yeah. ...... live streaming of other venues?",
	"734988": "The momentum of the blue drill head has not weakened, but rather has strengthened further, becoming more powerful and ...... forceful!",
	"734989": "It's like they're fighting each other to test their abilities and compatibility and stuff, right?",
	"734990": "Not good, the pink twin ponytails reached out to the side of the blue drill head. No way! You don't think she's trying to subdue the drill head with her joints!",
	"734991": "Wow! Pink twin ponytails kneel blue drillheads on the ground. I feel like I'm about to be taken to a ladies' tea party!",
	"734992": "Kinkong kankong. Kinkong kankong.",
	"734993": "It's almost time for dinner.",
	"734994": "It looks like the grouping of the classmates is almost over, so it's safe to go now.",
	"734995": "(I think I'll hang around here a little longer, and if nothing seems out of the ordinary, I'll head back to the dorms.)",
	"734996": "Hah .......",
	"734997": "Hah .......",
	"734999": "Siksik .......",
	"735000": "Are you still acting out?",
	"735001": "Pfft, hahahaha -- Karin, I think our play this afternoon was pretty good, wasn't it?",
	"735002": "Tiara, how do you rate the board?",
	"735003": "Here we are - oh, our odds have gone down so much already.",
	"735004": "The topic of strength on the bulletin board is usually the lowest estimate of our chances of winning, but the topic of us comes up frequently.",
	"735005": "Based on the pre-calculated moral score formula and the real-time evaluation information collected in the chat room, ...... we are not going to get jumpy unless we really mess up.",
	"735006": "I purposely stayed late to get more attention, ditched the General Knowledge exam, which has a low percentage of points, and earned a solid score for the less obvious Moral .......",
	"735007": "So now our plan, it's a success, right? And it's a great victory, isn't it?",
	"735008": "It's too early to open the champagne when you haven't reached the end yet.",
	"735009": "Open a bottle of champagne when you haven't reached the end? What does that mean?",
	"735010": "Don't get so attached to ............. I mean ...... celebrate big time when you're not completely victorious.",
	"735011": "So that's what you meant ......When you celebrate a victory, you open a bottle of champagne. ......Tiara knows a thing or two.",
	"735012": "Come to think of it, before you know it, most of the new students will be using the school's bulletin board.",
	"735013": "That's for sure. Besides, information about our examinations is quickly becoming known to people as soon as the examinations are completed.",
	"735014": "Well, it's working in our favor, isn't it? It was embarrassing, but I guess the power of public opinion is immense.",
	"735015": "But why is it known so quickly? ......",
	"735016": "Bon appétit.",
	"735017": "As we chatted, Arkria quietly brought the food out to the table.",
	"735018": "It's very grand, isn't it!",
	"735019": "It wouldn't be good to suppress your feelings all the time. And we need to celebrate in moderation. Especially since Tiara hasn't had a soda for the past two days, right?",
	"735020": "That's right! I don't have the money though. ............",
	"735021": "All the money I had went into this bet, right? You've been eating nothing but sprouts for the past few days. ...... But Arkria, why did you suddenly buy so much food?",
	"735022": "Because I had some unscheduled income. Remember the senior citizen who rented out the virtual room?",
	"735023": "I remember.",
	"735024": "I helped a senior advertise his rental service to new students. So I got paid after the morning exam.",
	"735025": "By any chance - is that how quite a few new students came to know about the board?",
	"735026": "Yes, I know. I have a real exam starting tomorrow, and I need to improve my diet. Of course, I don't want to go on a binge.",
	"735027": "So this dish, please eat.",
	"735028": "Yay!",
	"735029": "There's soda--I have a hunch!",
	"735030": "It's in the fridge.",
	"735031": "Perfect!",
	"735033": "HamuHamu...... this is so delicious~!",
	"735034": "Hey, did you guys see what happened at Arkria's playground today?",
	"735035": "I saw it. I was a little worried that I would attract undue attention because I had received a perfect score on the General Knowledge exam, but I later found out that it was an unnecessary worry.",
	"735036": "I'm not good at battles, so my score in the actual battle might be very low, so I have to keep my score beforehand to balance it out.",
	"735037": "Arkria was very cute, but I would not have known that she was acting if I hadn't been told beforehand.",
	"735038": "I'm so embarrassed.",
	"735039": "Come to think of it, though, Karin was pretending to be dumb, too, wasn't she?",
	"735040": "Oh ............ yes, yes, yes.",
	"735041": "Tiara was playing an autistic child with a paranoid communication disorder, right?",
	"735042": "<size=15>I'm one of those people or ....... </size>",
	"735043": "Oh, did I say something wrong?",
	"735044": "No, no, no, yes. It's all an act.",
	"735045": "I tried to play the role of an arrogant young lady of the so-called troublesome type, but did you guys see it?",
	"735046": "I was very confident about it. ...... I prepared a lot of lines in advance. But few people spoke to me, and I could hardly show off as much of my performance - how, am I not playing well?",
	"735047": "<size=15>...... didn't look like you were playing. </size>",
	"735048": "Well, was it that the acting was too true to life? I felt that the atmosphere was such that it could be conveyed without speaking.",
	"735049": "I see. I had the talent of a ...... scammer, didn't I?",
	"735051": "Tiara doesn't eat at all. She is like a hamster. She can't grow up that way.",
	"735052": "My stomach is made for ...... eating sweets. ......",
	"735053": "You don't have to say it like it's a belief you'll keep for the rest of your life.",
	"735055": "Delicious. Another one--oh, no? No more?",
	"735056": "I have a few more ramen noodles to go.",
	"735057": "Then give me that as soon as possible, too.",
	"735058": "Wait a minute. Karin, look closely.",
	"735059": "Hm? Ugh! Spicy ramen again? Do you love spicy food, Arkria, by any chance?",
	"735060": "No, I don't. I don't really have a sense of taste.",
	"735061": "<size=15>Do you have a taste buds? </size>",
	"735062": "I'm going to stop eating spicy food after all. ......",
	"735064": "............ me, I will try again.",
	"735066": "Don't you think it is tantamount to admitting defeat to not eat the food in front of you, even though you are not yet full?",
	"735067": "I don't think at all.",
	"735068": "Anyway, please let me try.",
	"735069": "Okay, I'll do that. I'll boil the water then.",
	"735071": "It's ready. .......",
	"735072": ".................. gobbledygook.",
	"735073": "I still think you shouldn't do it.",
	"735074": "Flay flay, Laniat. I'm counting on you~.",
	"735075": "............ Karin, would you like to join us?",
	"735076": "What?",
	"735077": "A knight needs a good partner. I would like to share with you the honor of this ramen challenge.",
	"735078": "Flawless, Karin. I'm counting on you~.",
	"735079": "Eh, um--yes. Tiara, you haven't had it yet, have you?",
	"735080": "Nyaha!",
	"735081": "Isn't Tiara the only one among the fellow students who live together in the ...... hah...... dormitory who has never eaten hot ramen noodles? We were partners as one, weren't we?",
	"735082": "I don't like it. What are you guys going to do .......",
	"735083": "Don't worry, don't worry, it's actually not that hard. Just try it and you'll see.",
	"735084": "Really?",
	"735085": "Here you go!",
	"735086": "So just a sip of ............ then?",
	"735088": "Don't touch me！！！！！ Don't touch my soda!",
	"735089": "Why not just drink what you open yourself!",
	"735090": "That one is not kinky cold!",
	"735091": "It's an ugly struggle.",
	"735092": "Yes, ...... it's time to end the meal.",
	"735093": "In the end, Arkria ate it all up in the end.",
	"735094": "Yes, the drinks stocked in the room are getting low.",
	"735095": "Guys, I'm going to get a drink.",
	"735096": "Drink Drink~",
	"735098": "That should be enough, right? Okay, let's go back.",
	"735100": "I wonder if those two are still in pain and heaving.",
	"735101": "Tomorrow is finally the real exam, and you wouldn't fall ill from such a cause, would you?",
	"735102": "Actual battle hey .............",
	"735103": "Ha!",
	"735105": "After all, nothing happens.",
	"735106": "What is it about my sacrament that has awakened in what way? I don't think anything has changed.",
	"735107": "Oh well. Let's get back soon. I'm sure everyone will be waiting for us.",
	"735108": "It's pretty fun to live with Arkria and the other three ...... something.",
	"735111": "Let's hurry and get back to our rooms too.",
	"735112": "Hm?",
	"735113": "Can you come here for a minute?",
	"735114": "Sounds like someone is calling me, right?",
	"735115": "I went toward the voice.",
	"735116": "I gradually approached it and stood right in front of the person who approached me.",
	"735117": "Under the moonlight, I saw a beautiful woman with a smile on her face.",
	"735118": "The person wore a strange gentleness and seemed relaxed as he sat on the bench. Then he clanked his chair and urged me to sit down, too.",
	"735119": "Is this guy some kind of Taoist or something? Or is he some kind of ghost that only appears on spooky nights?",
	"735120": "None of them are different. She was wearing a badge on her chest, so ...... yes, she is a teacher in the tactical department.",
	"735121": "Excuse me, Karin. My name is Shizuhi Wu. You can call me Wu Sensei. Please have a seat.",
	"735122": "...... yeah.",
	"735123": "I sat next to the teacher.",
	"735124": "I'm a new teacher at the academy and I'm in charge of the first grade.",
	"735125": "You are the student who was being told this and that by Ms. Irma today, aren't you?",
	"735126": "Oh, yes, Dr. ......, what about it--?",
	"735127": "I was wondering if you might be depressed by any chance.",
	"735128": "The doctor then lightly took my hand and sat a little closer to me, facing me. Then he looked at me with the cat on his shoulder.",
	"735129": "Your grades don't seem to be good, are you feeling pressure?",
	"735130": "Then the doctor came even closer to me. I suddenly felt a very nice fragrance.",
	"735131": "(Damn ............ how do I answer that? I don't want to disappoint the teacher too much. .......)",
	"735132": "Difficult to put into words?",
	"735133": "(No, we have to stay calm here. Now we have to play the role of the scum student left behind in society who can't ...... do anything, so here's what I have to do: .......)",
	"735134": "Ugh ............ shikshu!",
	"735135": "I'm sorry, sir. I tried my best, but no matter how much I study, I just don't get it.",
	"735136": "Was that so?",
	"735137": "According to what I've heard,...... Siksik,...... if you fail your first term exam, you might get sent back,...... and it will be on your record and you'll be discriminated against even after you graduate. ...... and that it will be on your record and you will be discriminated against even after graduation. ......",
	"735138": " What should I do? ............",
	"735139": "(Flickr!)",
	"735140": "Siksik.",
	"735141": "(What, are you crying? ! )",
	"735142": "I'm sorry for the ....... I have shown you the embarrassing part.",
	"735143": "You know, I'm just starting out as a teacher too. ......",
	"735144": "Is that ...... tissue there?",
	"735145": "Although I have just started teaching, I have a strong feeling that my teacher is definitely going to be a passionate teacher!",
	"735146": "Hot-blooded teacher?",
	"735147": "I had this dream on my sixth birthday, and I made up my mind. I decided that one day I would become an educator who would not fail people and bring smiles to children's faces.",
	"735148": "We decided that no matter how failing our students were, we would never leave them behind, and we would make sure everyone was happy!",
	"735150": "Oh, wow.",
	"735151": "I ...... want to be friends with my students! Karin, will you be friends with my teacher?",
	"735152": "Eh? Its ...... umm .......",
	"735153": ".............................. ...... No?",
	"735154": "Miko-sensei's eyes are watering and tears are about to spill out. Wow, Sensei, you smell so good!",
	"735155": "...... yes yes yes it will be! How can you not like it?",
	"735156": "That's good to know! Then I will call you Karin from now on. Since we are friends, will you call me Shizuki, too?",
	"735157": "...... That is indeed a bit .......",
	"735158": "If you don't feel comfortable calling him that, you can still call him Miko-sensei.",
	"735159": "Even if you fail the first exam of the term, it's okay. The teacher wants to grow with Karin, so let's work together, shall we?",
	"735160": "Oh ............ yes?",
	"735161": "So, Karin, would you allow me to be <b>the faculty advisor</b> for you and your four roommates?",
	"735162": "Faculty advisor?",
	"735163": "Didn't know about faculty advisors yet? The Tactics Department at Honkai Academy has a faculty advisor system. Simply put, faculty advisors are responsible for assisting their students in their daily lives and guiding them as they work on assignments given by the school.",
	"735164": "In other words - the teacher wants to establish a ...... closer friendship with Karin!",
	"735165": "Yeah, yeah, yeah. .......",
	"735166": "(What should I do about this? I've done my best to play this up to this point, but things are getting a little messy, aren't they? What is this \"faculty advisor\" thing? I've never heard of them before?)",
	"735167": "Thanks for the teacher ............! I think I want to be good friends with Miko sensei too, but I still think I need to ask my three roommates for their opinions as well. ......",
	"735168": "So can I check with my roommate before I answer?",
	"735169": "That's okay. It is enough to know how Karin feels.",
	"735170": "The teacher wiped away tears.",
	"735171": "Actually, I don't need to get consent from the student to assign a student to be assigned by the supervisor. I just wanted to hear your feelings directly from Karin.",
	"735172": "I, for one, have decided. Karin is the most necessary student for her teacher - we should work hard together! Let's work hard! Go! Go! Fight on!",
	"735173": "on............?",
	"735174": "Well, that's enough for today, goodbye~!",
	"735175": "I was gone in an instant. Weird Teacher .......",
	"735177": "Oh, that's right, I have to get back to the dorms soon. My cold drink is getting lukewarm...",
	"735178": "Yeah.................. yeah......... ....",
	"735179": "I woke up.",
	"735180": "Looking at the clock, the time was still early. I could afford to sleep twice. This must be a conditioned reflex that I have acquired through years of training. This is what has allowed me to become an excellent adult.",
	"735181": "I slipped out of the messy covers, changed my clothes and wandered over to the mirror.",
	"735182": "Yeah ...... Well, it should be fine and appropriate.",
	"735183": "Look, rookie. You have to get up and go to work now.\"",
	"735184": "Voices echoed from outside.",
	"735185": "Yes, I understand. Irma-senpai, would you please go ahead~.",
	"735186": "I saw the report you turned in yesterday, and I was wondering if you are now the faculty advisor for Karin Meride's group?\"",
	"735187": "Yes, I do, but?",
	"735188": "You should do a little bit of good right after you get assigned to the academy.\" Didn't I say so? The allowances that teachers get are tied to the assignments they are allotted, and to some extent, the performance of the students they are assigned as supervisors determines the assignments they are allotted.\"",
	"735189": "The faculty are counting on you, the first graduate of the legendary School of Tactical Studies.\"",
	"735190": "I think you should be more careful in choosing the students you assign.\"",
	"735191": "...... Yes, I know - thank you, seniors!",
	"735192": "...... but well, maybe you'd be a good fit for them?\"",
	"735193": "What does it mean?",
	"735194": "I mean, \"floundering.\"",
	"735195": "I don't have any bad intentions. I don't have any bad intentions. I'll go ahead.\"",
	"735196": "I hope ............ seniors are right~!",
	"735198": "Now, let's go have breakfast.",
	"735199": "Yeah ...... this taste .......",
	"735201": "Meal kit!",
	"735202": "Thanks for the food.",
	"735203": "\"Sister Shizuki: --------\"",
	"735204": "A figure seemed to approach me in an instant, and then it hugged me and rubbed up against me.",
	"735205": "Oh, Mr. Wang.",
	"735206": "I'm back at the academy~!",
	"735207": "Yes, have you eaten in the morning yet?",
	"735208": "Not yet. I just got off the night shift, actually, and I'm still working overtime on a robbery that happened two weeks ago.",
	"735209": "This time, the criminal drove away to the sewage treatment plant and then lost his footing. All of our investigators went through every piece of surveillance footage. ...... I don't think he could have transported it that easily without using a car because he had a lot of cash. ......",
	"735210": "Have you considered the possibility that it was the Stigmata user who did it?",
	"735211": "Two weeks ago, it rained, didn't it? If the culprit had the ability to manipulate water, wouldn't it be easy for him to use a drainage network to transport things?",
	"735212": "Certainly. Then I'll look into it along those lines now--",
	"735213": "Don't be so hasty. Do you want to work overtime that badly? I brought this for lunch. It's a bit much, so why don't you eat some of it? Here you go.",
	"735214": "Ahhhh.",
	"735215": "Since there was still some time before work time, I decided to take a short walk with Mr. Wang.",
	"735216": "Ahm, yes, Shizuki-senpai. When you're a teacher, this time of year, you pick the students you're in charge of and work on their assignments, right?",
	"735217": "Have you figured out your responsibilities and assignments yet? Are you going to continue to stay in Changku City? Or will you be going far away?",
	"735218": "Since I am now a teacher, I will be in Nagora City most of the time. I will have to wait until after the first exam of the term to find out what the assignment is.",
	"735219": "But I actually already have one task that I have decided to accomplish at all costs.",
	"735220": "Is that by any chance Dr. Estherine's example assignment?",
	"735221": "Oh, so you know about it too, Mr. Wang? Oh, no wonder. You are in regular communication with our students, aren't you?",
	"735222": "That's right. I've caught people skipping class, vandalizing stuff, mercenaries with part-time jobs, and people pretending to be anonymous allies of justice. ......",
	"735223": "If I didn't have to deal with the crazy students at Honkai Academy, I'd be happy too.",
	"735224": "If Mr. Wang knows about it, it means that Dr. Estherine's assignment, is really famous.",
	"735225": "In that assignment, we run not one, but 12 groups, each consisting of a mentor teacher and a student. And we send each group to different parts of the world to gather information, and the inspection teams in each corps also work together.",
	"735226": "There are quite a few benefits to participating in it, and they can definitely get a senior teacher rating just for doing it for two years.",
	"735227": "So seniors can go to ......?",
	"735228": "I'm going to leave it to the people who want to do their best in the jungle or snowy mountains, because I don't want to be bothered with that kind of thing.",
	"735229": "What?",
	"735230": "I, for one, am going to take it easy this year, choosing the easiest of the many assignments.",
	"735231": "Eh?",
	"735232": "Perhaps I'm misremembering ...... Shizuki senior seemed to be a very hardworking person ...... when she was a student?",
	"735233": "You used to be a bad girl at Senba Academy. People change. If I were asked to say my motto, I would say...",
	"735234": "Effort is to make it easier to slack off in the future.",
	"735235": "But is it really so easy to get what you want? The assignments allocated to teachers by the school depend on the ability of the teacher and his/her students, right?",
	"735236": "That's right. That's why I made an especially hard effort and meticulously observed the performance of this new group of students in detail.",
	"735237": "Is that effort also for skipping out in the future?",
	"735238": "That's right. And you know what - yesterday, I finally found them - four absolute scum students.",
	"735239": "These are the four.",
	"735240": "I showed Mr. Wang a photo of a student I had saved on my phone.",
	"735241": "Which is .......",
	"735242": "Those four, if they are the last to finish in the exam, will be quarantined and undergo reinforcement training.",
	"735243": "This would mean that I, for one, would not have to work outside the office for the entire first semester, and I would be able to sleep in every day.",
	"735244": "Wait. I know these four.",
	"735245": "These four guys, we met a while back in Changku City, and we were working as a team right away. We broke through a joint force of the PMC of the Eastern Legion, the Southern Continental Alliance, and the Three Heads Alliance that joined forces.",
	"735246": "Well, even though it was a joint unit, most of them were just regular land force soldiers. But I think the operational skills of these four are, to put it mildly, in the upper-middle range of this term's freshmen.",
	"735247": "Are you sure you're okay?",
	"735248": "............ ff.",
	"735249": "I know that too.",
	"735250": "If those four are pure scum, I would certainly be given a lot of troublesome assignments by the teaching department. ...... Then I would have to do a lot of work to solve the problems myself, because I don't want to watch young kids die in front of me, right? I don't want to see a young girl die in front of me.",
	"735251": "Then, do you still think that these four students will get very bad grades in the exam? At Honkai Academy, the scores of the actual examinations account for a large percentage of the overall score, and if the four of them show their true potential, they will probably get a pretty good grade.",
	"735252": "Yes, but what if the four of us had never intended to show our usual strength?",
	"735253": "Eh? Does that mean ...... those four people are pretending ...... they can't do it on purpose?",
	"735254": "Yes, it is. I, for one, thought otherwise when I saw the video of the exam room. Those four people must have intentionally scored poorly on the written portion of the exam.",
	"735255": "The child who is the leader of that group of four is called Karin Meride.",
	"735256": "I met with her last night to see if she was taking bad points on purpose.",
	"735257": "After all, she is a high school student, so it is not so easy to hide what you are thinking. From the way we talked yesterday, she was not at all concerned about her low test scores and was trying not to let me know that she felt that way.",
	"735258": "Besides, she's a \"purposeless\" person.",
	"735259": "No sense of purpose?",
	"735260": "Yes, she is. Most new students come to Honkai Academy for survival, revenge, etc., but she is not. And she has no sense of acting for some great ideal.",
	"735261": "She comes to Honkai Academy as if she were attending a normal school.",
	"735262": "The conclusion I draw from the above is.",
	"735263": "Karin and her colleagues are on the right track in each ability, but they are the kind of kids who deliberately perform poorly on exams.",
	"735264": "I think the reason why they do that is the same as ...... me. It's to be lazy and easy.",
	"735265": "That's why I've decided to be their faculty advisor. That way, when they slack off, I can slack off with them, and when they need to work hard, I can poke them a little and let them show their true ability and finish what they need to do on their own.",
	"735266": "That way, I'll have it easy forever!",
	"735267": "You're a man without a sense of purpose. ......",
	"735268": "You know, when we were just starting high school. All of my peers, all of the freshmen in the tactical department--",
	"735270": "Oh, ......, no, it's nothing. You know what, I'm going back to the base for now--",
	"735271": "Yay. I have to get back to work.",
	"735274": "-- [You have arrived at H-1. Please make sure you do not forget anything when disembarking.] --",
	"735275": "This morning we will start the actual exam.",
	"735276": "Huh, new students this term, let's have them show us how good they are.",
	"735277": "Hey, newcomer, you're here.",
	"735278": "You are on time, so you are not late. Senior~.",
	"735279": "Since you are new, you should have come a little earlier. That way you will make a good impression on your colleagues.",
	"735280": "Yes, yes, yes.",
	"735281": "Speaking of which, has the battle started yet? No. Have you started the actual battle test?",
	"735282": "Not yet. They are still measuring physical fitness. The development department wants to get data on the new students. Look, ......, the students you're in charge of just walked in.",
	"735283": "Thank you - now I'm off to take care of my students.",
	"735284": "I am charged with maintaining order today, so go ahead.",
	"735285": "You don't have to back out every time you want to go, do you, rookie?",
	"735286": "Yes, seniors.",
	"735287": "(Senior Teacher Irma Ingrid. She used to be a captain in a hunting party under the umbrella of the Three-Headed Alliance, then betrayed the military and escaped to Honkai Academy a little over two years ago.)",
	"735288": "(Perhaps because he was in the military for so long, he is inflexible in everything he does, but he is very bold and rough with his words. But in reality, he's very personable--easy to get rid of.)",
	"735289": "(A little over two years ago, which means that ...... must have betrayed him in the wake of the Chunxiao Incident.)",
	"735290": "Laniat Gordias de Eumenes.",
	"735291": "He is the sole heir of the famous warlord, His Excellency Gordianus, and is the manipulator of the \"Sacrament of Analysis\" double-helix profile.",
	"735292": "(Like me, it's a sacrament that relies very heavily on information.)",
	"735293": "The more you understand them, the more destructive they become.",
	"735294": "If you could \"fully understand\" your opponent ...... you could obliterate them with ease, no matter how strong they were. Such an unreasonable sacrament.",
	"735295": "It's done. Hmph, 10 shots, all 10 points - how about that?",
	"735296": "And by the way, you also broke the target of another child.",
	"735297": "But unfortunately, the owner of this stigmata is a simple-minded and rather stubborn idiot, and he has not been able to use the power of the stigmata well.",
	"735298": "Tiara Staloumos.",
	"735299": "Take a look at the ...... file to see how to name this .......",
	"735301": "I knew he was a child from the slums of the lowest strata of the Eastern Legion. Street children without parents like to use these names, don't they?",
	"735302": "According to the documents she provided, .......",
	"735303": "I can't believe I was raised by a broken down and discarded early childhood education robot.",
	"735304": "It seems that you have been in the gray zone business on the Internet for a long time in order to survive.",
	"735305": "The ability of the stigmata is \"heavy armor type stigmata\" in this document. ............",
	"735306": "You'll soon find out that this is a lie.",
	"735307": "The most famous heavy-armor type of sacrament is the Honkai hero Bronya Zaichik, but according to existing records, the bearer of a heavy-armor type sacrament can summon a mobile weapon at any time, so there should be no need to keep a mobile weapon close at hand.",
	"735308": "Yo, you did good. ...... gigantics.",
	"735309": "The coordination with the battle mech is very poor, and this child does not seem to be very good at battles.",
	"735310": "However, the school does not require that the facts about the stigmata be declared, so it is not a problem if they are concealed.",
	"735311": "Arkria Hroptr.",
	"735312": "The sacrament he has is the \"Sacrament of the Heart\". But the identification code is still unknown, and as for the ability, we know so far that it can remotely synchronize the mind.",
	"735313": "One possible application of this would be to establish a mental link with the people around you and use it to build a chain of command.",
	"735314": "So much for practice. And the machine is back in place.",
	"735315": "This ability is very useful as a front line commander in the dead zone. However, her combat ability as a soldier is very poor, so she needs to work harder in the future.",
	"735316": "But, well, it looks like we can see future growth with this child.",
	"735317": "And the last one, Karin Meride.",
	"735318": "We just have to destroy everything anyway, right?",
	"735319": "You come from an anarchic area outside the jurisdiction of the Legion. You grew up in a single-mother home, and your mother is a bounty hunter and a literal \"courier transport\".",
	"735320": "You have been touring cities as her mother's assistant since she was a little girl.",
	"735321": "The identification code of the stigmata is unknown, and its ability is also unknown. She herself does not know what kind of power she has, and she is fighting simply on the basis of her reflexes, which are superior to those of other people, and the operational experience she has accumulated over time, right?",
	"735322": "Because of their good personalities, they are able to play a central role in the communication among the other three.",
	"735323": "Is that it? You're going to start the actual exam right after this. ...... eh?",
	"735324": "Karin - I saw how well you did earlier. It was very good.",
	"735325": "I'll do my best today. I'll definitely surprise you!",
	"735326": "(Do you still play?)",
	"735327": "Yes, I'll be watching her closely. I'll be watching Karin's performance, doctor.",
	"735328": "Oh? Is this the teacher that Karin mentioned yesterday?",
	"735329": "Yes, my name is Shizuei Wu. My name is Shizuhi Wu, and I am a new teacher who has just started working here.",
	"735330": "What a very prominent teacher. ......",
	"735331": "Hello Dr. Miko. My name is Arkria Hroptr.",
	"735332": "Yes, I know who you are. You are all very energetic children.",
	"735333": "Kinkong kankong. Kinkong kankong.",
	"735334": "Good luck everyone - I'll be right by your side cheering you on, doctor!",
	"735335": "Yeah, let's go then.",
	"735337": "-- [Karin Meride, vs. Snake Bone Yumeko",
	"735338": "Hello.",
	"735339": "I like the posture. Are you trying to make it look dramatic by pretending to be strong at first and then suddenly failing?",
	"735340": "-- [Get ready. Begin!] --",
	"735341": "Don!",
	"735342": "Wow, you killed a second.",
	"735343": "-- [That's enough. Both sides out.] -- [Both sides exit.",
	"735344": "As soon as the fight started, you instantly jumped into your opponent's pocket, stopped his momentum, and immediately locked in a joint, pinning him to the ground. It was an overwhelming victory.",
	"735345": "That move is different from the one trained in the military. It must have been drilled into him by someone at home, or gradually refined in street fights.",
	"735346": "It's quite a level - Karin Meride.",
	"735348": "Oh, wait a minute... ...... seconds killed!",
	"735350": "Tiara, what's going on with the online forum?",
	"735351": "Mm-hmm--",
	"735352": "Hahaha, just as I thought, the board, it's a big deal, like poking a beehive!",
	"735353": "Everyone is getting excited about why Boks are so strong. Some are saying they want to change their betting partners, but it's too late. Phew.",
	"735354": "The chat room manager in charge of accepting bets has already closed the window at 3:00 a.m. today, and the odds have been finalized.",
	"735355": "So that means ............ we win?",
	"735356": "That's what you mean?",
	"735357": "So let's have a celebration party!",
	"735358": "Oh, wow!",
	"735360": "Shupon!",
	"735361": "We opened a bottle of champagne!",
	"735362": "You really opened it!",
	"735363": "If we don't celebrate the triumphant return with a grand ceremony, it would be - on the contrary - impolite!",
	"735364": "Oh, but it smells pretty sweet ...... a little--",
	"735365": "Laniat, that's not orange squash you're holding!",
	"735366": "Orange squash? But the manager said it was champagne?",
	"735367": "Look at the label. It says \"orange squash\" on the label.",
	"735368": "Mumz...... No, actually I knew that. I thought that drinking alcohol was not good for everyone's health, so I bought a carbonated beverage that looks similar.",
	"735369": "You really hate to lose, don't you?",
	"735370": "........................Moggle, gulp, gulp... .....................",
	"735371": "But why did they suddenly stop the exam, halfway through?",
	"735372": "Something must have happened at the school.",
	"735373": "It doesn't matter. I'm tired and I don't even want to think about it.",
	"735374": "Hmmm... ...... why do I feel a little uneasy?",
	"735375": "Is there a reason?",
	"735376": "Huh?",
	"735377": "Do you have any idea why you feel uneasy?",
	"735378": "Well, I don't know either. I don't know, there is something uncertain about it.",
	"735379": "I guess I would have to call it intuition. I always trust this kind of intuition.",
	"735380": "Arkria is the type of person who makes decisions logically, right? If Arkria thinks it's okay, then I wouldn't have to worry so much about this uneasy feeling I'm having.",
	"735381": "But you can't keep doing exams, and now you have nothing left to do.",
	"735383": "No, there is.",
	"735384": "Tiara, I wonder if you could show everyone your account.",
	"735385": "Account?",
	"735386": "Yeah, the one I mentioned the other day. ...... Okay, .......",
	"735387": "Here it is.",
	"735388": "What is .......",
	"735389": "Honkai Gakuen - All Things DESU\"?",
	"735390": "What is \"DESU?\"",
	"735391": "DESU seems to derive from a certain language of the Western Era--DESU.",
	"735392": "I don't care about that. Let me explain more about ....... The account of this all things shop is .......",
	"735393": "I mean, you know, what can I say? Now that I got into Honkai Academy, I thought I'd brag about it online at .......",
	"735394": "Besides, I thought .................. that I might be able to resell a lot of things if I make such an account.",
	"735395": "Yeah, I did that username search ...... which one is .............",
	"735397": "<size=50>What, you're chastely exposing others on the internet! </size>",
	"735398": "Sorry, sorry, sorry!",
	"735399": "And yet you have so many followers, don't you? But they don't seem to be following you because of any other needs in their lives.",
	"735400": "Like we're all here to watch Tiara shoot her mouth off at people on the internet?",
	"735401": "There is no way I can run an account as a normal all-person! I just want to bring down the hammer of cyber violence on those who have been criticizing me in DMs.",
	"735402": "So, do you have people who DM you asking you for help? Or someone who asks you for a favor, like they want you to help them out as an all-around good guy?",
	"735403": "It can be found at ...................",
	"735404": "Tiara, how about this. For the time being, I will manage this account and use it to gather information about incidents that have occurred in the city of Nagora.",
	"735405": "And when you're done with that, how about returning the account again?",
	"735406": "I have a lot of sub-accounts, and I don't mind them. ......",
	"735407": "So from now on, you will go around solving the problems of people who are having difficulties in their lives in Chokoku City, based on the feedback you receive on your account, right?",
	"735408": "Yes. And to make the whole plan more solid.",
	"735409": "I certainly agree. What do you think Tiara?",
	"735410": "Oh, you have to go volunteer at .............",
	"735411": "Siksik...... this is also for repayment...... boku...... yeah...... okay .......",
	"735412": "Laniat?",
	"735413": "............ umm .......",
	"735414": "Laniat?",
	"735415": "Oh, sorry. I was just looking at a few of the posts on All Things Considered.",
	"735416": "Kohon...... it's a little vulgar, but ...... it's pretty interesting...... it's definitely a little vulgar, but it's a little vulgar.",
	"735417": "Tch. .......",
	"735418": "Then the next target is ...................",
	"735419": "Your teacher will call you to resume the exam, or you'll be notified that the exam is over and your grades will be announced--until then, you'll have to wait.",
	"735420": "--I think you should continue to work in Chang Kuai City.",
	"735421": "Yeah. .......",
	"735422": "Yeah. ...................",
	"735423": "Yeah.",
	"735425": "I woke up again.",
	"735426": "The curtains were rolled back and the cold moonlight outside shone into the room.",
	"735427": "The sun had not yet risen.",
	"735428": "According to the notice I received out of the blue, the exam scores will be announced at 8:00 this morning.",
	"735429": "That means the exam is over.",
	"735430": "Why did I wake up when I originally planned to sleep all the way until a little before 8:00?",
	"735431": "Oh well. Let's go out on the balcony and get some fresh air.",
	"735433": "foo~",
	"735434": "I took a deep breath and felt somewhat energized.",
	"735436": "Yes, let's do it again.",
	"735437": "Yeah. .................. good!",
	"735441": "I knew nothing was going to happen. ......",
	"735442": "My awakened sacrament is .......",
	"735443": "How in the world did you get awakened?",
	"735445": "I shouldn't have done that. I think I shouted a little too loud.",
	"735447": "Yeah, it's still quiet at night.",
	"735448": "And the Long Sky Market is still supposed to be at night, right?",
	"735449": "Speaking of which, where exactly is Honkai Academy located? Is it in Changkuu City?",
	"735450": "If it is in Changkuu City, where in Changkuu City?",
	"735451": "But if it's not in Changku City, why is the timing of day and night completely linked between the academy and Changku City?",
	"735452": "That's because the Honkai Academy sky is man-made.\"",
	"735454": "The day and night changes, the stars moving, everything is made to resemble the real thing.",
	"735455": "If you look at the sky at the school through a precision telescope, you'll see that it's actually represented in fine pixels.",
	"735456": "I am sure that the reason it is synchronized with the time in Changku City is because although the ride can go directly to the transfer cities of the four major corps, it is in Changku City where the students go to play the most, and the school's related facilities are also in Changku City.",
	"735457": "Arkria？",
	"735458": "Good evening.",
	"735459": "Did I wake you up by yelling?",
	"735460": "No. The company is not a member of the National Association of Schools and Colleges of America.",
	"735461": "Arkria shook her head lightly.",
	"735462": "I couldn't sleep for a bit either.",
	"735463": "So it was.",
	"735464": "Yeah, I'll let you guys have a little chat.",
	"735465": "Huh, Arkria is really sweet.",
	"735466": "You're so sweet. .......",
	"735467": "She stood quietly by my side, not commenting on any particular expression of kindness I made.",
	"735468": "It only made me feel that she was here.",
	"735470": "...... Arkria, you have something you're trying to accomplish, don't you?",
	"735471": "The things you plan to accomplish?",
	"735472": "Yeah.",
	"735473": "Ummm...what would you say ......?",
	"735474": "I don't know what it is, but I have a feeling about it.",
	"735475": "Everything Arkria does has some kind of meaning, and I think she is acting for some kind of ...... goal.",
	"735476": "What about Karin?",
	"735477": "What?",
	"735478": "I wonder if Karin thinks she has a goal in mind for what she does?",
	"735479": "Hmmm... ...... maybe not? I'm not the kind of person who eats, plays, walks around randomly to kill time every day.",
	"735480": "Well, of course, I'm learning!",
	"735481": "The following is a list of the most common problems with the",
	"735482": "I don't think so.",
	"735483": "I think Karin just doesn't realize it because she sees it from her point of view. I can see it. I know that Karin has a goal.",
	"735484": "Is there a ......?",
	"735485": "If not, I don't think Karin would have been so distressed earlier.",
	"735486": "Eh? Oh, Arkria saw you.",
	"735487": "I've been practicing a little bit to see if I can manipulate Honkai energy from hiding.",
	"735488": "I'm curious to see what I can do.",
	"735489": "But there was no response at all, and I asked my ...... mother and some of my seniors, but they told me that normally they seem to be able to use their powers naturally without doing anything, and they don't know how to advise me.",
	"735490": "Isn't that, in other words, Karin's goal right now?",
	"735491": "You're worried that you're the only one who can't use the power of the Stigmata normally.",
	"735492": "I see what you mean. ...... That's certainly true when you put it that way.",
	"735493": "So why don't you start with some simple training?",
	"735494": "Hm?",
	"735495": "In the moonlight, Arkria extended her hand toward me. In her hand was a chess board.",
	"735496": "As stated in the Honkai Energy Education Guidelines created in '41, every sacrament and structure is the most fundamental force that exists.",
	"735497": "It's about \"receiving and releasing,\" and \"reconstructing.\"",
	"735498": "When Arkria said this, the frame collapsed and was gone.",
	"735499": "The matter on my hands is not mine to control, but I can at least release this mass.",
	"735500": "This is what we call converting matter into Honkai energy.",
	"735501": "I'm sure I've seen it many times, but it's still ...... very strange .......",
	"735502": "Then Arkria took my hand in hers.",
	"735503": "What? Huh?",
	"735504": "They were tied in a lover's knot.",
	"735505": "The hand is lifted as it is.",
	"735506": "He came up to both of us.",
	"735507": "The hand that was holding it left.",
	"735508": "You showed up again, didn't you?",
	"735509": "Arkria was holding the earlier frame with two fingers, pinching it.",
	"735510": "Yes, it has reappeared. That's because I've brought back the matter that makes up this panel from the Honkai universe again.",
	"735511": "It releases matter, sends it away, and then recalls it again. This is also the principle of operation of the void printer, and since the end of the Great Honkai War, it has become a basic ability that all sacramentalists and recipients can use.",
	"735512": "So, if I could do that, I would at least be able to do it at .......",
	"735513": "I reached out and tried to touch the frame.",
	"735514": "Bread!",
	"735515": "Ugh!",
	"735516": "When I touched it, the frame burst and was gone.",
	"735517": "There is a limit to how much one person can handle. Therefore, if the material is small and unstable, it can easily collapse and disappear.",
	"735518": "I see. So this approach is just practice.",
	"735519": "Yes. In most cases, it won't help you in a battle. Some schools with plastic arts majors specialize in teaching this skill, though.",
	"735520": "More than 30 years ago, the World Construction Corps also used this technology and unparalleled organizational capabilities to reorganize the postwar world. ...... Yes, the so-called hyperurbanization movement.",
	"735521": "Then I'll try it too. What shall I use? ...... Yeah, I'll use this clothesline.",
	"735522": "Yeah. ...................",
	"735523": "Hmmm ........................... ....",
	"735525": "Feelings.",
	"735526": "I can feel it. ......",
	"735527": "I feel a connection between you and another world. ......",
	"735528": "The echoes coming through from the empty wilderness can be found at .............",
	"735529": "Yeah. ...................",
	"735530": "Do you think I can hear ...... ......?",
	"735532": "<size=50>uuuuuuuuuuu---- ------！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！ </size>",
	"735534": "<size=60>uuuuuuuuuuu---- ------！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！ </size>",
	"735535": "Hey guys ...... I was playing a game with headphones on, did you hear anything from outside?",
	"735536": "Maybe ............ Arkria, do you know what that is now?",
	"735537": "I don't know. I'm sure Karin's intuition was right.",
	"735538": "Dong-dong-dong!",
	"735539": "Dada, who is it?",
	"735540": "Room 213, meet me downstairs immediately.",
	"735541": "From outside the door, I heard a call and the person who said it was leaving in a quick pace.",
	"735542": "Room 214, meet me downstairs immediately.",
	"735543": "Soon a voice was heard from near the door of the next room, conveying similar content.",
	"735544": "What does this mean? ......",
	"735545": "Examination.",
	"735546": "Let's go. We'll be right down.",
	"735548": "When I opened the front door, I saw many people moving around in the hallway. And from the upper floor, there was an incessant knocking on the door.",
	"735549": "The four of us went downstairs, opposite the teachers who were going around waking us up.",
	"735550": "As I left the dormitory, a cold wind blew against me, reminding me that it was still daybreak.",
	"735551": "The moonlight illuminated the classroom building, creating long shadows. I looked down and saw many people standing in the shadows, and the badge on their chests, indicating that they were faculty members of the tactical department, glowed faintly.",
	"735552": "And out of the shadows, in the cold wind, was a lone faculty member, holding his hat with one hand and looking at his wristwatch with the other, calculating the time. His clothes were fluttering in the wind.",
	"735553": "Good evening. The students I work with--",
	"735554": "Dr. Miko, what the hell is going on--",
	"735555": "You were slower than the students from the military, but you managed to get into the first group. Follow me.",
	"735556": "The teacher said this and moved on. We had no choice but to follow.",
	"735557": "Late at night in the H-1 district, the lights were turned off, and not a single person was happily chatting, as if in another world.",
	"735558": "The only people present were the teachers and seniors who stood silently at the bend in the road and urged us to move on. It was as if this world, and the school, were instantly .......",
	"735559": "It felt as if it had become a fortress.",
	"735561": "Thus, we hurriedly followed Dr. Shizuhi Wu to the teaching building and entered.",
	"735562": "In the teaching building, all the usual bright white lights were turned off, leaving only the flickering emergency lights on. The reddish lighting created an eerie atmosphere and brought out the outlines of the building.",
	"735563": "As we followed the teacher into the elevator, the elevator made a sound and went down instead of up.",
	"735564": "The sound of the elevator moving along the rails continued for a while, and we finally emerged from our unusual world of colors.",
	"735565": "What do you think? Are you surprised?",
	"735566": "The teacher turned to us.",
	"735567": "This is going to the exam, right?",
	"735568": "Yes, we are heading to the place where the final assignment for this exam will be given. I'll explain the rules and other details later.",
	"735569": "It's kind of ...... very serious, but .......",
	"735570": "Have the exams so far seemed less serious?",
	"735571": "Awww, bo, I'm not like that. ......",
	"735572": "But you're right.",
	"735573": "What?",
	"735574": "It was not serious enough, wasn't it?",
	"735575": "The numbers on the screen gradually changed and the elevator finally stopped.",
	"735576": "Therefore, we are asking you to experience the earliest content examinations that were conducted in the beginning.",
	"735577": "As the elevator doors slid open, I heard the airlock open.",
	"735578": "Dr. Shizuhi Wu walked out of the elevator and turned toward us, her hands outstretched to her sides.",
	"735579": "Behind the teacher was a jungle made of steel.",
	"735580": "Welcome to the H-A-3 military weapons hangar at the school!",
	"735581": "Oh-hon!",
	"735582": "It's already past 10 minutes. ...... when it comes to the quality of this term's students. ...... at all.",
	"735583": "Students who got there first, gather around me. I'll start with those who have been briefed on the rules of the test.",
	"735584": "Try to swallow the situation as quickly as possible. You can leave as soon as you hear about the rules of the test.",
	"735585": "There are so many weapons. But from the looks of it, they all seem to be live ammunition, right?",
	"735586": "Mm? There are bullet holes. ......",
	"735587": "It looks like I accidentally shot him when I tried to mount the weapon.",
	"735588": "Come to think of it, what does H-A-3 mean?",
	"735589": "......H-A must refer to deck A of section H, which means the zone we are in right now at the school, right?",
	"735590": "I think the 3 refers to the level of weapons. Because everything here is only weapons using live ammunition, not a single Honkai energy weapon.",
	"735591": "So 2 is a weapon of Honkai energy?",
	"735592": "I think so.",
	"735593": "Hm? I wonder what's in the weapons hangar with the 1 then?",
	"735594": "It's the Mobile Knight. It is the most well-known general-purpose war weapon in the Southern Legion.",
	"735595": "It is a weapon that can only be controlled by a recipient who has undergone physical modification or a sacramental user, and it is a very high-performance monster.",
	"735596": "I believe the model number on this one is WK-37, aka Chalk Knight.",
	"735597": "Tiara, do you know?",
	"735598": "Is that much information available on the Internet!",
	"735599": "That ...... I've just ...... made plastic models and I've ...... made plastic models.",
	"735600": "What about you ......?",
	"735601": "Hello, students!",
	"735602": "I don't know, I feel like I've seen ...... somewhere before. ......",
	"735603": "Go ahead and listen to the explanation first. We'll talk more about Sirin later.",
	"735604": "Yes. I will now explain the rules of the test.",
	"735605": "In case some of you still don't understand what this is all about, what we are going to do is the second half of the actual portion of the exam at the beginning of the term. The point ratio is higher than the first half.",
	"735606": "Oh, dear?",
	"735607": "Jiji then, our efforts to date have been made possible by .......",
	"735608": "First, let's hear the explanation.",
	"735609": "I agree. In any case, what we need to do now, and what we can do, is to win.",
	"735610": "Currently, there are a total of 10 Mobile Knights in the urban area of Changkuu City that were transferred to our school from the Southern Legion after they were decommissioned.",
	"735611": "The model number and performance are the same as this one behind me. The school bought it and uses it as a training machine.",
	"735612": "All mobile knights are equipped with non-lethal weapons. So the test you are about to do is--",
	"735613": "The idea is to fight these 10 mobile knights in a battle of survival until the sun comes up, and then compete for points.",
	"735614": "You're early!",
	"735615": "Do you? Oh, but you might feel that way. Because you've probably never seen these before in the military, and even the older ones, they don't compare to the civilian ones.",
	"735616": "So it's hunting.",
	"735617": "Points are awarded for destroying or damaging a knight. Conversely, points will be deducted if the knight is wounded or if he destroys a civilian building during the fight.",
	"735618": "Also, please note that if a student's student ID card is taken by a mobile knight, he or she will be considered dead and will not be able to engage in any further activities until the examinations are completed.",
	"735619": "The test will end when one of the following three situations occurs",
	"735620": "I. If it is 5:00 a.m., the examination will be over at that time because civic activities take priority from 5:00 a.m.",
	"735621": "Two, if the student's side is completely eliminated. In this case, too, the test is over - I will feel very disappointed and ashamed of you guys if this is the result.",
	"735622": "Three, when all the mobile knights are destroyed. As a student of our school, I should still aim for this. I would be very proud of myself if I did!",
	"735623": "And also because all previous restrictions on students' authority will now be officially lifted.",
	"735624": "We go to Mr. Sirin nearby to have the restrictions lifted, and then we're off.",
	"735625": "Sirin？",
	"735626": "Okay, that's it, let's start the final exam!",
	"735627": "Hello. Excuse me, can I see your student ID card?",
	"735628": "Ah ...... are you that Sirin? One of the Honkai heroes and the right hand man of the Houraiji school headmaster.",
	"735629": "Hmph, Sirin is just assigned to do chores for the busy Kyuushou-sama.",
	"735630": "It seems like Sirin in games and cartoons is somewhat smaller than ...... the real thing.",
	"735631": "Because Sirin ...... is getting bigger.",
	"735632": "Yes, you can now use all of your authority. Finally, you can take the oath of your rights and duties as a student of Honkai Academy, according to the regulations.",
	"735633": "May I?",
	"735634": "Yeah!",
	"735635": "Now you are officially a member of Honkai Academy starting today.",
	"735636": "While you are in school, any attack aimed at the sacrament is considered a direct provocation against the entire Honkai Academy, including the faculty, and even against the Honkai Dean, because it is considered a direct provocation against the Honkai Dean.",
	"735637": "There is only one outcome for such provocations. The person who carried it out and the person who gave the order are all executed.",
	"735638": "But at the same time, I'm supposed to tell you, because I'm supposed to tell you, if you go off campus to work on an assignment or during a vacation, and an armed conflict breaks out and you die, the school is not supposed to pursue the other side for responsibility. This is because Honkai students are not considered instruments to challenge the current international order.",
	"735639": "This is also the content of the contract signed by the World Construction Corps and Houraiji Kyuushou.",
	"735640": "And, you know, the contract allows for finite and unlimited intervention rights for all students at Honkai.",
	"735641": "So on a regular basis, students can go directly to institutions and companies for practical training without consent from the upper division and without going through the screening process.",
	"735642": "That, and in the event of a crisis of Honkai, the students of the academy have the duty and right, without any prior formalities, to take temporary control of the first line of operational units of the four major legions and execute a mission that will not affect the administration of humanity, but purely to stand against Honkai.",
	"735643": "In that case, the higher the grade level, the greater the scope of responsibility each of us assumes.",
	"735644": "In summary, Honkai Academy gives students a power and protection they never had before, helping them to realize their individual dreams.",
	"735645": "But for that, students must take on the mission of observing the world closely, developing a deeper awareness of themselves, and making the necessary choices when necessary.",
	"735646": "Just like they say in our school motto. How about it, do you understand? Juniors.",
	"735647": "It's necessary. ...... Oh, sorry. I got carried away. I understand!",
	"735648": "Yes, and then you each choose a weapon of your choice from the weapons hangar and head to the test site.",
	"735649": "I wish you all the best.",
	"735651": "...................",
	"735652": "Yeah. .............",
	"735653": "...... do you have something like that for me too?",
	"735654": "Fluffy ............ uu.............",
	"735655": "I've been playing games for a while now and I'm getting sleepy. ......",
	"735656": "The students are divided into groups to different parts of the city center. Karin's group is still some distance away from the designated starting point.",
	"735657": "Why don't you get some sleep?",
	"735658": "There is no way I can sleep at a time like this!",
	"735659": "Karin, you know what you are getting into, don't you? This is a major crisis!",
	"735660": "Yeah ...... this situation is indeed a big crisis.",
	"735661": "This test will be quite difficult with the composition of our group. Laniat comes from a military background, so I would certainly ask you about mobile knights.",
	"735662": "Can a mobile knight fly ......?",
	"735663": "It will fly.",
	"735664": "I see. So only a laniat can knock that off ......, right?",
	"735665": "Teacher: ...... Mobile knights don't have pilots or anything on the inside, do they?",
	"735666": "I'm not on board. All of the Mobile Knights used in this test are running on military-grade smart cores.",
	"735667": "If a pilot who can manipulate Honkai energy were on board, it would be impossible to break the shield with live weapons in the first place, and in that case, the school would distribute Honkai energy weapons to the students.",
	"735668": "Then why don't they give out ...... Honkai energy weapons? I, even though it's not that I can't manipulate them.",
	"735669": "Because it's too powerful.",
	"735670": "This is not a dead zone front, you see. Honkai energy weapons have high output and long range, and if you shoot carelessly, you might shoot through several walls at once and kill a civilian sleeping soundly in a house a few kilometers away. That is an absolute no-no.",
	"735671": "It is not only the students. In the new Chang Kuai City, purification committee members and various underground forces are also strictly forbidden from using long-range Honkai energy weapons.",
	"735672": "That's also why most of the fiercest people in Chokku City are using swords.",
	"735673": "Ummm... ...... yes... ...... Tiara's battle mech was in the back of the car, wasn't it?",
	"735674": "Yeah, but don't expect gigantics to have an effect on the war effort. ......",
	"735675": "Gigantics are made from civilian parts, so they might be somewhat useful against humanoid objects, but with this power and strength, there's too much difference between them and military weapons to be toothless.",
	"735676": "Ugh. .......",
	"735677": "There is no need to be so depressed. Other students don't necessarily have the ability to beat the knights of mobility.",
	"735678": "I don't think we should leave it to chance or anything like that, do you?",
	"735679": "Besides, this is the first exam of the term. Isn't it enough if you just give it your all?",
	"735680": "Or visit .......",
	"735681": "You guys don't have some other plan in mind all the time, do you?",
	"735683": "That's not why ...... sir, don't say strange things.",
	"735684": "What's up with that? Tell the teacher too!",
	"735685": "Maybe the teacher is the one who is after something else.",
	"735687": "This test is fundamentally unsuitable for our group, with its particular distribution of members' abilities, isn't it?",
	"735688": "Why do you say it like that? The doctor just--",
	"735689": "Do you really think they care?",
	"735690": "Because there would be no incentive for the teacher to just do something.",
	"735691": "Assignment.",
	"735692": "The better the grades of the students in the groups I'm in charge of, the more complex and difficult assignments the teachers can assign.",
	"735693": "The hardest and most exhausting assignments are those given by Dr. Liebtruth, and generally only the best students in the grade are allowed to work on them.",
	"735694": "I'm told that the nature of the assignment, though, is to recover some of Honkai Academy's research results that were stolen three years ago.",
	"735695": "The teacher doesn't want that assignment assigned, right?",
	"735696": "Haha, Arkria is very perceptive.",
	"735697": "What you said earlier, although ridiculous, was certainly correct about some of the information you mentioned along the way.",
	"735698": "You are a newcomer to the academy, sir, so why would you think that you can take it easy?",
	"735699": "You are clearly upset.",
	"735700": "Mr. Arkria, where did you get the information you mentioned earlier?",
	"735701": "It's a tarot reading.",
	"735702": "Hahaha ...... fortune telling should tell you that .......",
	"735703": "Plus I have a crystal ball.",
	"735704": "Ugh. .............",
	"735705": "Oh, just in time. It looks like we've arrived at the designated place. Please hurry up and get out of the car.",
	"735707": "I'm sorry, I know I offended your teacher because I was rude to you earlier.",
	"735708": "He is not angry. It is very important to question everything.",
	"735709": "I mean this with all my heart. I love you, teacher, and I love Arkria-san.",
	"735710": "Well, that's that then. I'm going to go now, doctor.",
	"735711": "Don't you have some supervision by your side or something?",
	"735712": "You can't do that. There was a case once where a student used a teacher as a shield. That is also against the rules.",
	"735713": "Well, you never know what tricks the students will come up with. See you later.",
	"735716": "Hmmm...so now the real testing can finally begin, right?",
	"735717": "Arkria, what do we do now ...... Arkria?",
	"735718": "...... Sorry, I'm a little impatient.",
	"735719": "What's wrong?",
	"735720": "It's an old bad habit of mine. I like to make long term plans and work on them, but I always seem to lose control of my feelings when I get off track with my plans.",
	"735721": "I think we were definitely set up by Dr. Miko.",
	"735722": "So you are saying that ...... she is doing all this just to prevent herself from getting difficult assignments? No way, that's such a shameful act. ......",
	"735723": "I ...... can't believe you didn't detect it in advance and have no operational plan prepared to deal with it.",
	"735724": "This disqualifies you as a chief strategist. ...... Yeah?",
	"735725": "Karin？",
	"735726": "I shook Arkria's hand.",
	"735727": "It's nothing to worry about. Besides, the other students didn't know anything about the exam, just like us.",
	"735728": "Let's put all those things aside and take care of the immediate problem first.",
	"735730": "...... phew. .......",
	"735731": "I understand.",
	"735732": "So what do you want to do now at ......?",
	"735733": "I have to solve my problem first.",
	"735734": "What's wrong with Arkria?",
	"735735": "I know myself, too. That I am the weakest link in this group and that I am almost incalculable as a force in the battle.",
	"735736": "But having been with Arkria, I can naturally see what strengths you have.",
	"735737": "So I thought about what I should do first from that starting point, and I came up with a general idea.",
	"735738": "Miko-sensei has created a lot of troublesome situations for me, but I got an ...... inspiration when I heard his last words earlier.",
	"735739": "Yeah, yeah, anyway, I have to cheer up first!",
	"735740": "I .......",
	"735741": "I'm going to ...... where there is one.",
	"735742": "Good evening. This is the base of the Purification Committee, how may I help you?",
	"735743": "I don't have anything special to say. I'd like to stand at this gate for a moment.",
	"735745": "If standing is not good for you, can you bring a chair?",
	"735746": "Is this guy some kind of thug?",
	"735747": "<color=#6666FFFF>Karin, Laniat, Tiara. I'm checking on the status of our communication. </color>",
	"735748": "OK OK OK",
	"735749": "Standby.",
	"735750": "I'm kind of not used to this kind of thing. ...... This ability of Arkria's, she doesn't know what kind of fantasies I have every day, does she?",
	"735751": "<color=#6666FFFF>I don't know, don't worry. </color>",
	"735752": "Hee!",
	"735753": "<color=#6666FFFF>Mine has arrived at the \"command post\". I'm going to give you a briefing on the mission now. </color>",
	"735754": "Yes~yes.",
	"735755": "<color=#6666FFFF>There are two problems we have right now. </color>",
	"735756": "<color=#6666FFFF>Problem #1: Members Arkria's operational ability is too low and she is easily defeated. </color>",
	"735757": "<color=#6666FFFF>This problem can be solved by moving Arkria to the gate of the Purification Committee, an agency of the Changku City government in cooperation with the school. </color>",
	"735758": "<color=#6666FFFF>If the mobile knights appear, I will immediately run inside the purification committee's base. </color>",
	"735759": "This would allow the three of us to lose restrictions on our behavior.",
	"735760": "<color=#6666FFFF>That way I won't be able to do anything as a movement, but I can be a stable command center for the operation. </color>",
	"735761": "<color=#6666FFFF>Then the next problem. </color>",
	"735762": "<color=#6666FFFF>Problem #2: Inability to detect the location of enemies. </color>",
	"735763": "Is the way we did it before not good enough?",
	"735764": "Is that how you see the surveillance camera footage of the roads in Chang Ku City?",
	"735765": "<color=#6666FFFF>I tried that earlier and found it didn't work. </color>",
	"735766": "No?",
	"735767": "<color=#6666FFFF>I did some research earlier and was able to see a video of a mobile knight being taken by a large trailer to a designated point and released outside. </color>",
	"735768": "<color=#6666FFFF>The mobile knights were let out of their trailers and they immediately took to the air. </color>",
	"735769": "I knew you could fly! You're so sneaky!",
	"735770": "<color=#6666FFFF>So a traffic camera that only shows the ground can't capture their location. </color>",
	"735771": "But if they're flying in the sky, wouldn't the public notice them right away?",
	"735772": "But the mobile knight is driven by the smart core, and the goal is set to carry out the exam mission, right? So the system should always be guiding the student to fight.",
	"735773": "It means that they are not flying all the time.",
	"735774": "You're so dependable when it comes to battles, unlike usual, aren't you?",
	"735775": "Does that mean you are saying that I am not cool or dependable on a daily basis?",
	"735776": "Aww, I forgot that I'm in a state where my mind can tell what I'm thinking. I can't whisper my way through this one!",
	"735777": "<color=#6666FFFF>Yes. They certainly won't be flying all the time, but I don't think they'll be congregating over the road either. Think of the snipers that would be more likely to shoot at us. </color>",
	"735778": "Yeah ...... so what do you want to do?",
	"735779": "<color=#6666FFFF>If there seems to be no reliable source of information, we should just walk around aimlessly and wait to encounter a mobile knight. </color>",
	"735780": "Reliable Sources. .......",

	"735782": "<color=#6666FFFF>Did I find it? Oh, okay. Sure there is. </color>",
	"735783": "What, what is it?",

	"735787": "I understand, Nyan. All things being equal, I'll settle it for my master, .......\" What is this?",
	"735788": "Sickening, cyber bullying is not a good idea. Everyone, let's lose such bad content from cyberspace~!",
	"735789": "Wow - you've posted some night views of the town and some literary writing.",
	"735790": "Ah, I see. So you solve citizens' problems with a heartwarming attitude of service!",
	"735791": "I'll do it, it's all great acting!",
	"735793": "Arkria, maybe you're embarrassed?",
	"735794": "<color=#6666FFFF>Not at all. Because it's all an act. </color>",
	"735795": "<color=#6666FFFF>Then use this account to find out where they are. </color>",
	"735796": "Posting a help-seeking post?",
	"735797": "No one is going to take that kind of crap from you. The internet is a bloodless, merciless shul.",

	"735801": "Sorry .......",
	"735802": "Can I help you?",

	"735804": "Let's do it.",
	"735805": "That's right. If you don't even have the courage to take the gamble, you will never win. Do it!",
	"735806": "Uu............ well then, I'll do it.",
	"735807": "You ...... are in the process of taking the test right now?",
	"735808": "Yes.",
	"735809": "<color=#6666FFFF>Now I'm going to start organizing and sending out the information. Just to be safe, could everyone please look around for any mobile knights? </color>",

	"735813": "Well, we have no reason to get rid of you, but it is still not a very pleasant feeling to be taken advantage of by teenage students.",
	"735814": "What then?",
	"735815": "With that she took out a chessboard and placed it between the chairs.",
	"735816": "Would you like to play a few games of chess with me? I am quite confident.",
	"735817": "Confidence enough to embarrass you .......",
	"735818": "Phew. .......",
	"735819": "All right.",
	"735820": "First move, please.",
	"735822": "Whoa, that was a quick response! Hundreds came in an instant.",
	"735823": "People in Changkuu City, don't you sleep at night?",
	"735824": "It seems that there are many people who have special jobs at night in Nagora City.",
	"735825": "But I haven't heard anything from Arkria yet. ......",
	"735826": "Tiara, can you check the status of your account? Please take a look.",
	"735827": "Yeah, which one is ............ Wow, that's a lot of pictures posted, huh?",
	"735828": "Yes, let me see--cah!",
	"735829": "What's wrong?",
	"735830": "Here's a horror picture: ...... How can the people who posted it be so low level? I'm so surprised.",
	"735831": "Are you that horrified? Let me see.",
	"735832": "You don't have to look at it. And there's more than just horror stuff.",
	"735833": "What kind of things are there other than horror stories?",
	"735834": "...... I can't explain it.",
	"735835": "I'll take these guys down.",
	"735836": "Calm down, calm down!",
	"735837": "<color=#6666FFFF>I found it. </color>",
	"735838": "You're early!",
	"735839": "<color=#6666FFFF>It's a narrow street near the Chang Ku City Urban Park station. I'll keep trying to track it--Checkmate.</color>",
	"735840": "So let's get started!",
	"735841": "It's still amazing that ...... can eliminate such a mountain of garbage information.",
	"735842": "First enter the street and then cross the pedestrian bridge.",
	"735843": "And finally, after fearlessly pushing forward through the empty streets late at night, and passing through an underground passageway, ...... finally--!",
	"735844": "That's what I found.",
	"735845": "A white weapon with an appearance that is incompatible with the town in the background.",
	"735846": "Found!",
	"735847": "<color=#6666FFFF>The jets on the back side are the weak spot, so focus on that--Checkmate.</color>",
	"735848": "I understand. We only have live ammunition, but Laniat can use her abilities to cause a lot of destruction, right?",
	"735849": "I'll leave it to Laniat to deliver the coup de grace.",
	"735850": "I understand.",
	"735851": "Then all at once - attack!",
	"735852": "Haa...... haa...... I'm glad I don't have a pilot.",
	"735853": "If the operator had been on board, we wouldn't have even been able to break their defenses with the live ammunition weapons we have now.",
	"735855": "Backward?",
	"735856": "I shouldn't, I'm going to run away!",
	"735857": "Immediately after I said this, dead leaves and dust on the ground flew up and blocked our view.",
	"735858": "Then I saw a purple plasma jet emit light in the smoke.",
	"735859": "The Mobile Knight flew into the sky at great speed: ------",
	"735860": "Laniat--!",
	"735861": "Locked on.",
	"735862": "Don!",
	"735864": "It's a shame. ...... was so close, but it got away.",
	"735865": "But I'm glad we got the war results.",
	"735866": "It is a war result finally obtained in the form of a surprise attack, though.",
	"735867": "<color=#6666FFFF>No need to be discouraged. That mobile knight must have done a lot of damage to his power system, so he should be able to catch up. </color>",
	"735868": "That's good to know. Karin, we'll catch up with you soon!",
	"735869": "Yeah ...... wait a minute.",
	"735870": "What's wrong?",
	"735871": "I have an idea.",
	"735872": "We still have a lot of time before dawn, and even if we only defeat that knight of maneuver, we won't necessarily be in first place, will we?",
	"735873": "Yes, it is.",
	"735874": "<color=#6666FFFF>We don't know the location of the other mobile knights yet, and given that the students in the other groups are scattered around the city of Changkuu, it is reasonable to assume that the mobile knights are also scattered around the city. </color>",
	"735875": "That means, you know, you have to defeat more than half of the mobile knights - that is, six of them - to keep the first place position unassailable.",
	"735876": "Can you do that at ......?",
	"735877": "I want to do it. Besides, I think it would be very interesting if we could win first place.",
	"735878": "Tiara！",
	"735879": "What, ......?",
	"735880": "If we kill one mobile knight, can we locate the other mobile knights from its wreckage?",
	"735881": "Hmmm I don't think I can do .......",
	"735882": "However, if the smart core is not broken, then with my sacrament and technology, I might be able to send a fake command to ....... But this is just a possibility, so don't get your hopes up.",
	"735883": "Karin...... are you seriously going to do that?",
	"735884": "If you might be able to do it, please do it.",
	"735885": "But you know,...... how do you neutralize a mobile knight without breaking the smart core in a situation where the pilot is not on the mobile knight,.......",
	"735886": "Leave that to me. And unless you do that, you're certainly not going to get first place.",
	"735887": "What do you guys think of this idea?",
	"735888": "If you are able to get to the first place position in such a unprecedented way, please contact us at .......",
	"735889": "I am sure you will be very proud of your family! So I will do it.",
	"735890": "Uu............ you really are a great guy.",
	"735891": "......Then ......I'll do it with you.",
	"735893": "<color=#6666FFFF>I will continue to support you. Karin, move immediately to the street on the other side of where you are. </color>",
	"735894": "Copy that. Let's go--",
	"735895": "Is this the second plane!",
	"735896": "Stay calm. We'll beat them no matter what!",
	"735898": "Now--!",
	"735899": "He dodged a fierce attack from above and rushed toward the mobile knight--",
	"735900": "Suddenly I felt the muzzle of the mobile knight's gun pointed toward me in an instant.",
	"735901": "I won't let you!",
	"735903": "Nice, Laniat--!",
	"735904": "I ignored the fact that I was in the sights of the mobile knight and rushed forward. Then the knight used his booster to rapidly retreat. A black smoke was produced from the broken launcher, and the knight was about to be engulfed by the black smoke as if he were an octopus spitting ink to escape.",
	"735905": "But my speed was greater.",
	"735906": "Hah!",
	"735907": "The sword entered the gap in the chest armor of the mobile knight. I then tried to pry it open using my hands.",
	"735909": "The mobile knight extended his huge arm and clenched his fist--",
	"735910": "Ohhhhhh, gigantics!",
	"735911": "Just as a fist was about to swing down, a battle mecha created by Tiara slipped out from the shadows behind the mobile knight.",
	"735912": "He then blocked the movement of both arms of that huge white monster.",
	"735914": "Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa--! ------！！！！！",
	"735915": "Karin hurry up. Gigantics joints don't last that long anymore!",
	"735916": "I'll do my best to open ---- and ---- ------!",
	"735918": "Open this ------!",
	"735919": "The cockpit opened almost as soon as Gigantics' hand was removed, and I ducked down, entered it, and held the smart core in my hand - and then I was in the cockpit!",
	"735920": "I got it!",
	"735922": "foo~",
	"735923": "I grabbed my smart core and went down to the ground.",
	"735924": "Then the giant weapon, deprived of its heart part, kneeled down powerlessly toward me.",
	"735927": "<color=#6666FFFF>Congratulations. You did it, you guys. </color>",
	"735928": "What are you talking about?",
	"735929": "We did it, didn't we?",
	"735930": "<color=#6666FFFF>...... sure. We did it, we did it. </color>",
	"735931": "Checkmate.",
	"735932": "Oh dear ...... you lost again.",
	"735933": "This is my eleventh station. I hope you enjoyed it, despite my lack of talent.",
	"735934": "If you are too modest, they won't like you. By the way, you can visit .......",
	"735935": "You, in some way, are now in command of your people, aren't you?",
	"735936": "Yes.",
	"735937": "How could he easily defeat me, a man who researches information and gives instructions to his colleagues, and yet boasts of his unbeatable chess skills in the office?",
	"735938": "Your ability as a new student, we have to admit.",
	"735939": "You give too much praise.",
	"735940": "I think it's time for me to stop bothering you. I wish you good luck with your exam and hope you get a good score.",
	"735941": "Thank you.",
	"735942": "<color=#6666FFFF>Is the hacking going well? </color>",
	"735943": "and ...... where I'm doing ............ yeah ...... apparently... ...apparently ...... can tell.",
	"735944": "Response! Don't report it?",
	"735945": "<color=#6666FFFF>Please. </color>",
	"735946": "The first plane is down here, so I don't need to tell you anymore.",
	"735947": "The second plane is ...... yeah, it's already destroyed near the aquarium station.",
	"735948": "Yeah.",
	"735949": "Hey, I have something good for you. Would you like to eat? I've ordered something to be delivered at dusk.",
	"735950": "It's okay.",
	"735951": "But it's a very delicious cake.",
	"735952": "Then, I'll have it after all.",
	"735953": "I see the 8th plane is near the ...... long sky building and heading towards the Hom Museum.",
	"735954": "Phew. .......",
	"735955": "Hm?",
	"735956": "Sounds were heard from the sky above.",
	"735958": "You are a knight of mobility.",
	"735959": "A pure white mobile knight made of steel landed softly on the ground like a butterfly.",
	"735960": "The ninth plane is at the south square of the ...... station, heading to the tourist information center.",
	"735961": "Then a mobile knight, huge yet light as a butterfly, moved his camera and looked at me.",
	"735962": "<color=#6666FFFF>There was a tenth plane. Location--</color>",
	"735963": "I dropped into the purification committee and waited for the mobile knight to disappear.",
	"735964": "The tenth plane is under the Eternal Anchor and has already been destroyed.",
	"735966": "Don ！！！！！！！！！！！！！！",
	"735972": "Oh, this is the person who came to eliminate me.",
	"735974": "The hunt. .............",
	"735975": "Beginning.",
	"735977": "Arkria, you sounded angry.",
	"735978": "As a teacher, you are supposed to set a good example, but to make a fool of your students is a bit much, don't you think?",
	"735980": "Well, that's okay. Let's not think about this and that.",
	"735981": "I don't want to be the pointless me I was before.",
	"735982": "Hmmm, in any case, I'll be done supervising exams in a few hours, and I don't have classes tomorrow, so I'll feel much better!",
	"735983": "Don -------- --------",
	"735984": "Is that ......? Oh, it's a mobile knight.",
	"735985": "I wonder which group I will be playing against.",
	"735986": "But from what I've seen, that mobile knight is a little .......",
	"735987": "That's a little odd, isn't it? To see the paint job, it looks like it is definitely from a training plane at the academy. ......",
	"735988": "Beep-beep-beep--!",
	"735989": "Hello?",
	"735990": "Seniors - I'm a firm examiner.",
	"735991": "What? The 11th Mobile Knight was caught on a traffic control video? And it's not sending out the identification signal required by the school?",

	"736019": "Dr. Irma, 30 seconds ago she found an unidentified mobile knight near Garden Road Station.",
	"736020": "...... just saw that info in the faculty chat group as well. It looks like the grade level head has already given instructions that all clues will be uploaded to the group chat.",

	"736038": "The Mobile Knight was equipped with Lethal weapons, whose attack power was at least ten times that of the trainer.",
	"736039": "This means that ............ pilots are on board. The shield of Honkai energy is so thick that live ammunition weapons are completely useless against it.",
	"736040": "And since they can handle all terrains on land, sea, and air, and their speed is superior to that of ordinary vehicles, they cannot run away even if they wanted to.",

	"736091": "<color=#FF8C00FF>............You called your friends, Arkria. But how will you escape ............? </color>",
	"736093": "Laniat's covering fire hit the mobile knight's armor one after another, sounding like a storm hitting the glass. But the force was as powerless as the rain.",
	"736094": "Those who manipulate Honkai can only be defeated by a large army, or one of equal strength.",
	"736095": "You're an eyesore. ------",
	"736096": "As if in response to the white knight's anger, hot air of heat dissipation came out of the joints of the mecha. Faster than that, I knew that a fierce blow was about to be unleashed - and it was about to be!",
	"736097": "We're running out of time. Let's stick to the plan.",
	"736098": "Giggity giggity giggity giggantics-- you got it? Then we're off!",
	"736099": "What--!",
	"736100": "I'm not going to let you kill me. Goodbye.",
	"736102": "<color=#FF8C00FF>............ I see, a train. ......... ...It's very convenient to be able to rule by touch. ...... </color>",
	"736103": "<color=#FF8C00FF>Tiara's battle mech had a rope hooked to the train and pulled you along just as it was leaving. ............ </color>",
	"736104": "<color=#FF8C00FF>...... you came up with such a plan ...... while running away when there was hardly any time ...... </color>? </color>",
	"736105": "<color=#6666FFFF>It wasn't the most flattering plan, but it worked anyway. </color>",
	"736106": "<color=#FF8C00FF>............ is it the power of friends ............. </color>",
	"736108": "<color=#6666FFFF>............You may be right. </color>",
	"736109": "Leaving the darkness behind, the train pushes forward over the moonlit rails and rushes through the long-empty city.",
	"736111": "Looking around, there was nothing particularly wrong with Karin, and Laniat and Tiara were not in bad shape.",
	"736112": "I didn't think we could escape safely from that real military weapon. ...... No, did we really get away with this? ............",
	"736113": "Laniat, do you think he can catch up with us?",
	"736114": "I think they will catch up with us. The top speed of a mobile knight is much faster than that of a train. Whatever you do from now on, it is better to hurry as much as possible. You have limited time to think and decide.",
	"736115": "It's a ...... hassle to fight and not win, to chase and not catch up, to run and not shake it off.",
	"736116": "And there's a lot of things we don't know about .......",
	"736117": "Who are they and how do they know the school's test plan? Why do they have a mobile knight painted for the school's training aircraft? What kind of abilities do they have? ......",
	"736118": "...... Well, don't be so hasty.",
	"736119": "Arkria, you may have a lot of questions, but we don't have time right now, so let's leave it at that for now.",
	"736120": "I'd like to go over a few things first. You can skip the reasons why you think so.",
	"736121": "I trust Arkria's judgment.",
	"736123": "Yeah.",
	"736124": "Do you think you can get away from that guy first?",
	"736126": "Impossible.",
	"736127": "So, do you think the doctor will be able to help?",
	"736128": "Maybe not. I'm sure my opponent will be thinking of countermeasures.",
	"736129": "Laniat, he calls the doctor.",
	"736130": "Yes.",
	"736131": "Last question, can we fight and win?",
	"736132": "I think there's a ........................ possibility.",
	"736133": "I see.",
	"736134": "Then let's fight.",
	"736135": "It came through.",
	"736136": "Everyone please return to the academy immediately. There are many mobile knights of unknown affiliation operating in the north of Changkuo City, and several squads have already been attacked.",
	"736137": "I believe the south side where everyone is is still safe, so please evacuate to the academy immediately. I think I can get there in half an hour too.",
	"736138": "Sir, we are already under attack.",
	"736140": "Was that so? Maybe the other party intentionally made you look to the north.",
	"736141": "I'm going to stop chasing another one and head that way immediately, because I'll be there in 15 minutes, no--10 minutes.",
	"736142": "Anyway, your first priority should be to survive.",
	"736143": "Beep!",
	"736144": "10 minutes. .......",
	"736145": "10 minutes or .............",
	"736146": "We have to do something on our own.",
	"736147": "Arkria, how do you think we can win?",
	"736148": "It's an Honkai bullet moved by the power of Laniat's Stigmata.",
	"736149": "That's true, if you ask me. Tiara's battle mech and my sword are not Honkai energy weapons to begin with, and Laniat is the only one who can break through that mobile knight's shield.",
	"736150": "The time available to shoot is very limited. In this battle, you will probably only have a chance to fire one shot.",
	"736151": "But can you beat it with just that one shot?",
	"736152": "......I think you can do it if you put all your energy into that one shot, without thinking about the future.",
	"736153": "This is what Arkria was referring to earlier when she said there was a \"chance\" of winning, right?",
	"736154": "Yes.",
	"736155": "So you're saying you're betting all your hopes on whether or not that one shot will hit? If it misses, what happens to us? ......",
	"736156": "I will surely guess it.",
	"736157": "Please believe us.",
	"736158": "Yes, I believe Laniat.",
	"736159": "Then ...... then I'll do my best to at least give you a chance to shoot one ............... .......",
	"736160": "By the way, the more I understand about my opponent, the more destructive my sacrament can be, what do we know about them now?",
	"736161": "Anything about the operator's image, height, personality, speaking style, preferences, etc.?",
	"736163": "Is it enough to have some information about the capabilities of the other's stigmata?",
	"736165": "It's been a while.",
	"736166": "The sniper sites are all set up and ready to go at ...... soon--",
	"736167": "Finally coming to ......?",
	"736168": "Don -------- --",
	"736169": "Came.",
	"736170": "A roar like artillery pierced the clouds and we looked up to the heavens.",
	"736171": "There was nothing in the sky.",
	"736172": "However.",
	"736173": "The thick clouds in the sky below the moon split in two, as if sliced in half by a sword sharpened even further.",
	"736174": "Then a dazzling white star emerged from the clouds and overlapped with the moon.",
	"736175": "I think that guy found us.",
	"736176": "The chalk stars emit a purple halo.",
	"736177": "No, to be precise, it is not a halo. It is a flood of Honkai energy at maximum output.",
	"736178": "The star seemed to stall as it reached its highest point and fell downward. Then it struck us like a meteor.",
	"736179": "It was as if he had forgotten himself.",
	"736180": "It was so fast that even the sound it made on its own-------- --It was so fast that it overtook and left behind ！！！！",
	"736182": "Oh, you're here.",
	"736183": ".................. that girl ......... ...and where's the sniper ......?",
	"736184": "I'll let you know if you beat me.",
	"736185": ".............................. ......My name is ...... hunt sinners.",
	"736186": "I'm Karin.",
	"736187": "Then let's begin.",
	"736188": "Hah--!",
	"736190": "------ It doesn't hurt--it doesn't itch. ----",
	"736191": "I know that.",
	"736193": "Wow!",
	"736195": "--Consumer machines? --",
	"736196": "--Don't make me laugh--!",
	"736197": "Aww, I can't hold on any longer. Shoot quickly!",
	"736198": "Gah!",
	"736199": "The hunter-gatherer stretched out his arms and shook off the shackles of his battle mech in an instant - and the battle mech was off and running.",
	"736200": "I knew that was coming. ------",
	"736201": "The frame rotated and the fire control system locked on. The pilot of the Hunting Sin Demon had to be an experienced warrior. The man had fought and used his limited time to--",
	"736202": "He had found the only point on this battlefield where he could snipe at his own weakness.",
	"736203": "And that's where they attacked--",
	"736204": "Don!",
	"736205": "Miss ----!",
	"736206": "You've run out of tricks - admit defeat - but you've lost!",
	"736207": "Ughhhhhh. ...................",
	"736208": "You're hooked.",
	"736209": "N--",
	"736212": "The mobile knight, who had been scrapped by us and had been lying down earlier, held the body of the hunted sin demon with great force at that moment.",
	"736213": "I'm a super genius sacramentalist who can command even the dead. Idiot!",
	"736214": "I'm sure you'll be able to pull off that trick soon...",
	"736215": "You won't make it in time anymore.",
	"736216": "The next moment, the door to the cockpit of the Gigantics suddenly opened, and Tiara smiled at how devious she looked.",
	"736217": "Then Laniat, who had been lying face down on top of Tiara, thrust the cold muzzle of her gun at the hunted sinners.",
	"736218": "You: ----",
	"736219": "I have already seen through your sacrament.",
	"736220": "You lose.",
	"736221": "Don!",
	"736222": "Ugh. ........................... .............................. ....",
	"736224": "I see. .............",
	"736225": "I thought it was you who was at the sniping point .............",
	"736226": "Ugh. .............",
	"736231": "A short time ago.",
	"736232": "If I can see through the opponent's sacrament and have a chance to catch him by surprise, I, indeed, can disable him with a single shot.",
	"736233": "But the chance to catch them by surprise is good, the question is how to see through their stigmata.",
	"736234": "Military recipients are usually chosen to spearhead or designated to support units based on the type of stigmatic affinity.",
	"736235": "For example, in the case of the Southern Legion, a good affinity for fire, ice, lightning, metal, and other stigmata would make you an Honkai hunter, and you would be assigned to a mission to target a hostile force's stigmata users.",
	"736236": "On the other hand, those who have not yet completed the development of implants corresponding to the awakened sacrament, those whose sacramental types are too useless, and those whose compatibility levels are all too low for that, will be mobile knights.",
	"736237": "So the type of mobile knight's stigmata is very difficult to predict because there are so many possibilities!",
	"736238": "Well, maybe not necessarily.",
	"736239": "I think you are being a little too judgmental. Just because someone is controlling a mobile knight, it doesn't necessarily mean that they are a regular pilot of a mobile knight.",
	"736240": "This time, the opponent decided to use a mobile knight, supposedly to confuse the teachers at Honkai Academy by blending in with the training machine used for the final exam.",
	"736241": "Earlier, doctor, you mentioned on the phone about the situation on the other side.",
	"736242": "A horde of mobile knights appeared. There were battles between the knights and some of the students, but none of them turned into long, life-or-death battles.",
	"736243": "-- yes, except for us.",
	"736244": "That means we are the most important target for the enemy.",
	"736245": "Yes, I agree. I too think you are correct in that judgment.",
	"736246": "If so, why do you think they sent only one mobile knight against us, even though there are so many of them, given the limited time available to target us?",
	"736247": "Arkria means ............ no but ...... no way ......?",
	"736248": "I understand.",
	"736249": "So the opponent's stigmata are heavy armor type stigmata.",
	"736250": "Heavy duty type of stigmata?",
	"736251": "There was no such thing as a pack of mobile knights in the first place.",
	"736252": "Each of the mobile knights the teachers saw was the same mobile knight that showed up at different times and in different places.",
	"736253": "The owner of a heavy-duty type of stigmata can summon a self-repairing machine. ...... Arkria said that the owner of a heavy-duty type of stigmata--",
	"736254": "You are saying that while moving, they summoned a machine, deliberately sent it in an unimportant direction, retrieved it without people noticing, and repeated the process of summoning it again in another location.",
	"736255": "But how did they do it?",
	"736256": "Subway.",
	"736257": "...... I see what you mean.",
	"736258": "So you have a heavily-armed type of stigmatizer riding the subway all the way around the city of Long Air to move quickly, summoning a spirit-linked mobile knight at each point.",
	"736259": "To draw the attention of the school's teachers to a phantom army that never existed in the first place.",
	"736260": "Mr. Arkria, did you expect that much in such a short time?",
	"736261": "No, this speculation is not yet well corroborated or evidenced, and I am not yet certain of it.",
	"736262": "I just thought of that at .......",
	"736263": "When that mobile knight's feelings were wavering, I noticed that the lights he was equipped with were also coming on and off erratically.",
	"736264": "I was wondering what such a situation would mean if there is a regular pilot on board.",
	"736265": "............ You are indeed Arkria.",
	"736267": "You got ...... cleaned up as planned.",
	"736268": "The mobile knight, who called himself a hunting crime demon, had already been neutralized by us. Laniat did not fail in that most important moment and finished off the mobile knight with a single shot, as expected.",
	"736269": ".................. fu......... ...How about .............",
	"736270": "The system that Mobile Knight needs to run ......, it's completely busted. ............ It's a success!",
	"736271": "That's good to hear ............ Karin's idea of a strategy ...... worked well.",
	"736272": "Is Arkria ok?",
	"736273": "Karin turned toward the sniper point and told me so.",
	"736274": "I got a little graze on my clothes, but I'm fine.",
	"736275": "Laniat?",
	"736276": "I'm a little ...... dizzy ...... but ............ yeah, it'll be fine after a while It will be fine after a while.",
	"736277": "It seems that the blow he had just fired had drained his strength too much. However, it would have been impossible to defeat the opponent with a single blow without going that far.",
	"736278": "Huh ...... I feel kind of nauseous ...... but I guess we're all good now, right?",
	"736279": "When I say solved, 70% of the time it's just. The other party has a heavy-armor type of sacramental structure, so they can repair the aircraft. But even if they do, it will take time.",
	"736280": "Until we can fix it, whoever was controlling it shouldn't be able to beat the four of us.",
	"736281": "But that doesn't mean we can let our guard down. ......",
	"736282": "Kak .......",
	"736283": "Looks like it's still working?",
	"736284": "...... not finished ...... yet ----!",
	"736285": "Well, let's give ...... another shot--!",
	"736286": "Wait, something's not right--",
	"736287": "......It's not good. ......",
	"736288": "At that moment, I felt as if time was moving very slowly.",
	"736289": "But what on earth can they do in this situation?",
	"736290": "What can you ...... do with that battered aircraft?",
	"736291": "No, no. I get it. This discomfort is not caused by a hunting demon.",
	"736292": "Karin--did you feel it too?",
	"736295": "Lightning flashes in the distance.",
	"736297": "Laniat, following Karin, noticed this as well.",
	"736298": "Laniat then immediately defended Tiara, who had not yet noticed anything.",
	"736300": "This sacral structure is ............ lightning.",
	"736301": "Are you with the person who controlled the Mobile Knights? No, no. The hunted criminals are gradually disappearing .......",
	"736303": "Does that mean the person who was manipulating you showed up? No. ............ apparently the other party is .......",
	"736304": "Can you manipulate the ......2 sacramental structure?",
	"736306": "This is ...... ugh ............ Laniat, Tiara!",
	"736307": "It looks like lightning went through his body ...... but he's not dead, just unconscious. ......",
	"736308": "Don!",
	"736312": "........................hunting-sin-demon... Thank you for your hard work at .........",
	"736313": "I ............ me ............ I got there in time.",
	"736319": "Are you a bon voyeur?",
	"736321": "Probably not possible, but let me ask you this: ...... Can we stop now?",
	"736324": "Huff.",
	"736325": "The assassin girl smiled madly, holding a large crossed spear in her hand.",
	"736326": "A smile that comes from madness and excitement, a smile that forgets even the reason for laughing.",
	"736327": "How is that possible?",
	"736328": "Don't underestimate the military - and don't underestimate the military!",
	"736329": "...... Okay, I get it.",
	"736330": "It can't be helped. Sometimes these things are unavoidable.",
	"736331": "Karin shook her head and took her sword, pointing the tip at the assassin.",
	"736332": "The chain of the chainsword began to turn and gave a neigh as if to provoke.",
	"736333": "I'm not going to go easy on you - so be careful!",
	"736337": "--Haaaaah--!",
	"736338": "Hahahahahahahahahaha!",
	"736339": "Sparks and lightning struck on the deserted and lonely street, then separated again.",
	"736341": "We had long ago learned that the pilot of a hunting sinister was easier to put away than a mobile knight.",
	"736342": "The hunted criminals were quite formidable because they had powerful mobility to deal with any terrain and our side had no effective means to attack them from afar, but now our opponent does not have such disadvantageous conditions.",
	"736343": "But that said, I didn't expect Karin to .............",
	"736344": "How could you possibly go toe-to-toe with them?",
	"736345": "Karin's ability, is she even stronger than when the test started this evening?",
	"736346": "I can't believe that they can even forcefully break through the electromagnetic barrier that the opponent has.",
	"736347": "You're that good ---- --What's the matter with you?",
	"736350": "The area was instantly illuminated as if it were daylight by the sparks created by the collision of the crossed spears and chainswords.",
	"736351": "...... Kook--!",
	"736352": "Managing to shrug off the current that moved like a snake, Karin dispelled the crossed spears with her sword, switched from two-handed to one-handed, applied her rotational power, and struck the assassin in the stomach with her fist.",
	"736353": "The assassin's movement collapsed in an instant, the crossed spears left her hands, and she herself was sent flying backwards.",
	"736355": "But Karin moved even faster than that, grabbing her opponent by the collar and slamming him to the ground - and then into a position to slam him to the ground.",
	"736356": "Be careful--!",
	"736357": "Out of Karin's sight, the assassin made a gesture as if reaching for a crossed spear that had left his hand. Then the spear, which had been flying far away, suddenly stopped in mid-air, attracted by electromagnetic force, and attacked Karin and himself at once.",
	"736358": "I knew you would come to that!",
	"736359": "Karin, like a queen of the ball, again turned her body in a spectacular fashion, flicked the spear with the sword she held at her backside, and changed the direction of its flight. The spear flew with sparks and pierced the fallen assassin's side.",
	"736361": "Karin had the overwhelming advantage and was in a great position to take advantage--and she did.",
	"736362": "Karin swung her sword down as if to cut the lintel, and the assassin barely stopped her with the hilt of his spear.",
	"736364": "Kallen, however, continued to exert himself without concern, and the tip of his sword reached the ground, leaving a horrific cut on the chainsword. The spinning chain was reminiscent of the mouth of a ferocious crocodile, and it seemed only a matter of time before the assassin's head was cut off.",
	"736365": "However, the crossed spears continued to use electromagnetic force to stubbornly hold off the chainsword.",
	"736366": "Lightning and sparks intermingled, brightly illuminating their murderous faces.",
	"736367": "Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-- --------！！！！！！！",
	"736368": "..................aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-- ------aaaaaaaahhhh！！！！！",
	"736369": "A chainsword was pressed against it and could have reached the assassin's neck at any time.",
	"736370": "Once you get there, it's all over--",
	"736372": "But we just couldn't get there. So .................. the result was a victory.",
	"736374": "And a hand of steel stood before the sword.",
	"736375": "Lightning gone ............?",
	"736376": "Now we know why the body wasn't Honkai: .................. assassins are switching abilities!",
	"736377": "The time has come.",
	"736380": "-------- Ugh!",
	"736381": "............ hah............ hah... ................",
	"736382": "You've finished the ...... restoration of the Hunting Guilt Devil's .............",
	"736383": "Wooooooooooooooooo ！！！！！！！！",
	"736384": "............ not done yet ...... not done .......",
	"736385": "I haven't finished ............ yet ---- --!",
	"736386": "If you've come this far, there's no way you can leave it behind. The hunted sinners...... still rely on you in the end............ us together...... ...... together...... hahahahahaha--!",
	"736387": "...... Let's end this witch hunt--",
	"736390": "Ha. ......!",
	"736396": "No, you can't. You will never win.",
	"736397": "The Kari-Sin-Ma was only hastily restored, so its performance is greatly reduced and it should not be able to exist for a long time - but the presence of the Kari-Sin-Ma allows the assassin to gain mobility, including in the air, and Karin cannot even touch the enemy.",
	"736398": "And the understanding of the opponent's heavy armor type of stigmata, it's very good, even among the hunting class.",
	"736399": "On the other hand, it was fortunate that Tiara's battle mech was not summoned so that I could operate it directly and provide cover fire. Otherwise, we would have already lost earlier.",
	"736400": "But in this situation, it's only a matter of time before we suffer a ............ defeat.",
	"736401": "Gigantics are civilian level machines made from a combination of appropriate parts, so they are as fragile as glass compared to military mobile knights,...... especially mobile knights with pilots.",
	"736402": "However, if the hunting sinners are distracted by their attacks on me, the position of the assassins who now have the upper hand against Karin will be shaken. Therefore, if I keep a certain distance from the battlefield, there will be no room for the hunted crime demon to attack me before Karin is defeated.",
	"736403": "I looked at my watch for a moment. From the time I made the plan, to the fight, to now, .......",
	"736404": "Seven minutes, that's all that had passed yet.",
	"736405": "We cannot rely on the teachers to help us.",
	"736406": "If we go on like this, we'll lose, but this is a good way to do it: .............",
	"736409": "Karin--",
	"736410": "Arkria......。",
	"736411": "------ooooooooooo-- ----！！！！！！！",
	"736412": "...... hahaha............ gohgoho......... ...hahaha.......",
	"736413": "...... I won. ...... I finally did it. ............",
	"736414": "Do you think so? I don't think so.",
	"736415": "<color=#6666FFFF>Arkria, can you hear me? </color>",
	"736416": "I am, after all, a Stigmata user. I haven't used any special moves, throws, or super special moves yet!",

	"736610": "Karin released her great sword, and the sword disappeared as if melting into the wind before falling to the ground. Karin walked nimbly toward the assassin.",
	"736612": "The other woman had shattered bones all over her body. I could tell from the rise and fall of her chest that she was still breathing, but she coughed and coughed up what appeared to be shattered internal organs.",

	"736616": "I was scared. I didn't know if I could win, but I still had to win for sure.",
	"736618": "Can you tell me at the end?",

	"736621": "After a moment of silence, she opened her mouth and whispered.",

	"736632": "............ Yeah, he's dead.",
	"736633": "Now that all that's settled, let's go back to the academy.",

	"736646": "In the case of the recipient, the object to be \"linked\" is a real machine, unlike the heavy-duty type of sacramental user. This means that--",

	"736658": "Teacher?",
	"736659": "Doctor, you're late.",
	"736660": "I don't think so. I thought I had the perfect timing to make my appearance.",
	"736661": "...... Well, you could say that. Anyway, you're here and you need to get everyone back to the academy and treated as soon as possible.",
	"736662": "It's all over now.",

	"736664": "It's over. What are you all waiting for?",

	"736673": "...... teachers actually came to ...... long ago, didn't they?",
	"736674": "Yes, I did. Around the time when Mr. Laniat Gordias successfully shot that mobile knight, senior Irma and I arrived. After that, other teachers arrived one after another.",
	"736675": "So you guys - you were absolutely safe.",
	"736676": "But you know, this kind of feeling of being on the brink of life or death is rare and precious. That's why we followed the customary practice of standing by your side and watching you fight. Please don't be angry with us.",
	"736677": "I understand the logic that injuries should be trained on a daily basis as much as possible, so that no blood is spilled in a real fight. ......",
	"736678": "But my people need care and treatment. Now.",
	"736679": "Indeed it is. Amakusa Sensei! Is Dr. Amakusa here? Please give me a treatment--",

	"736905": "Yes. Did you find out anything about the identity of the attacker yesterday? Were they from our side?",
	"736906": "I'm still looking into it. I found a record of a stay at one of our hotels, but no information on the purchase.",
	"736907": "How did the attacker know what the school's exam assignment was? And who gave him the trainer?",
	"736908": "Valhalla is looking into it right now, but they haven't come to any conclusions. They also want me to send the results of the school's analysis to my senior.",
	"736909": "We don't know anything yet, but from the circumstances it doesn't sound like a military operation or anything. According to the story, one of the cavalrymen of the Enlightenment Division just suddenly left his unit to go on a witch hunt.",
	"736910": "I left ...... alone ............ for a witch hunt.",
	"736911": "If the division's upper echelons had dictated it, there is no way they would send out such a weak hunting party. And whether they failed or succeeded, they would have been executed by Honkai Academy, and a number of them would have been executed by Honkai Academy.",

	"736952": "Of course I'm happy for my teacher ....... Look, I'm almost in tears.",
	"736953": "I heard that if we do our best, it will benefit the teacher's work, right?",
	"736954": "Yes, much to the plus ...... teacher just thought it was a bit surprising. How did Karin's grades suddenly get so good?",
	"736955": "That's because the teacher is watching.",
	"736956": "Huh?",
	"736957": "I was moved by ...... what the teacher said last night! So I decided to try my best and play seriously against my classmates.",

	"736975": "...... Now it suddenly stood up!",
	"736976": "No, you can't. I will never end up here. Because I am - I am a first-year student of the legendary Department of Tactics.",
	"736977": "Now suddenly you're starting to get a fighting spirit?",
	"736978": "Irma senior, can you show us a little schedule of the matchups for the actual test?",
	"736979": "A schedule of matchups? The rules don't say you can't show it to the faculty member in charge, but it's not a good idea, is it? Because you are the faculty advisor for Karin's group. ......",
	"736980": "I would never give advice to those kids.",
	"736981": "What did they do to you?",
	"736982": "Senpai~~~ please help me~~!",
	"736983": "Duh! Oh, you really can't help who you are. ...... Yes.",
	"736984": "Thank you, seniors!",
	"736985": "(Really, it's easier than rolling in the palm of your hand.)",
	"736986": "Hey, miko sensei ...... you are an adult too, so don't act like that in public anymore.",
	"736987": "Is it okay as long as it's not in public?",
	"736988": "You're the one who wants to see the ...... look at the schedule of matchups, don't you? If you look quickly!",

	"737011": "You are joking! You are the future elite of the Southern Legion! And yet, you're going to get knocked down in the middle of a match over nothing! Are you a screwed-up high school girl? You don't go to class with a bun in your mouth every day, do you?",

	"737023": "Dear Paradox, I am Shizue Wu, a faculty member.",
	"737024": "Nyan~ What do you want from me?",
	"737025": "I need to access the academy's encrypted database with teacher privileges. The level of encryption is D-1.",
	"737026": "Access granted. Is there anything else you want to check?",
	"737027": "Tiara Staloumos, a sixth-year Tactical Studies student, fought with the military in Changku City before being officially enrolled as a student at the school.",
	"737028": "I would like to see her full operation video at that time.",
	"737029": "Roger that.",

	"737032": "Irma senior.",
	"737033": "What?",

	"737035": "She is a student named Tiara Staloumos, and she had falsely declared her abilities with her stigmata. Her ability was not a \"heavy armor type of sacrament\" in the first place, but a sacrament with an unknown identifying name called the \"sacrament of domination.\"",
	"737036": "Stigmata of domination?",
	"737037": "Yes. This is an ability that, once it touches the target's body, allows the user to give commands to the person touched. This ability also has a side effect: the user of the ability is forced to accept some of the feelings and thoughts of the person he commands. ............Maiden-in-Chief also agreed with my assessment.",
	"737038": "If the head maid approves, I guess that's what ...... is all about.",
	"737039": "But the academy also allows students to falsely report the abilities of the sacrament. Even classmates may become enemies in the future, and unless they are determined to stay at the school after graduation, students try to keep a low profile when using the sacrament.",
	"737040": "Yes, but what if those four were using their power to cheat on the exam?",
	"737041": "That's ...... what happened earlier in the game when the ...... Lillian squad fell all over the place in the middle of nowhere before the game--",
	"737042": "That's what I mean.",
	"737043": "But I haven't found any clear evidence either.",
	"737045": "Tiara, are you feeling better by now?",
	"737046": "That white-haired girl, super cute, I want to stroke her head, I want to touch her chin, I want to touch her belly, I want to touch her sides, I want to touch her - I want to touch her!",
	"737047": "Apparently, I am still under the influence of side effects and have mixed consciousness of others in my head.",

	"737051": "And very aggressive.",
	"737052": "Hmmm... ...... next game, do you think you can make it without Tiara?",
	"737053": "It's going to be okay. After a comprehensive analysis of all the freshmen's abilities, the team we just played had the best chance of beating us in terms of the composition of our forces.",
	"737054": "In other words, we've already broken through the biggest hurdle.",
	"737055": "I wonder if there are any other teams that have been hiding their abilities from the public like we have?",
	"737056": "There might be some, but that's okay.",
	"737057": "Based on the exam schedule and the results so far, you've already earned enough points to be in the top ten, even if you have the worst results in the future.",
	"737058": "Ho, if Arkria says so, that's a relief.",

In other words, he believed that people's current way of thinking had been influenced by the delayed economic relations and old ways of thinking of the Western Era, and that such ideas had to be abandoned in order to build a better new era. Many young people have come together in sympathy with this idea. They were determined to abandon the concept of their own region or country and call themselves citizens of the world. The concept of virtual idols, which could not be clearly identified with any one country's culture, became more popular than it had been at the time - if the Great Honkai and Aftermath Wars had not occurred, these cultures might have become prevalent decades earlier.

Later, when the Yucatan Big Dead Zone was established, the Enlightenment Division was involved in the Yucatan Big Dead Zone and disappeared, as was the First Corps, which was sacrificed as a sacrificial stone. That should have been the end of the Enlightenment Division. However, nearly three years later, in Corps A.D. 43, the Enlightenment Division broke out of the dead zone and suddenly appeared in the area controlled by the Provisional Assembly. At that time, the size of the Enlightenment Division was already less than 10,000 men, but there was no one who could stop them from returning from hell due to the vulnerable rear of the warlords' defenses - their goal was to break through the entire southern region and return to the First Corps.

Meanwhile, a bloodless coup d'etat on the part of the Provisional Assembly put an end to the radical line of counterattack.

People were not in a position to ignore it at that time. ---- The question is: What is Honkai energy, after all? Honkai energy can create fire and water, it can stop time, it can manipulate metals. Does that mean there is nothing it can't do? Perhaps because of this belief, a large number of frauds related to Honkai energy occurred in the postwar period. There were various scams, ranging from the sale of stones that were said to contain Honkai energy, to fortune telling using Honkai energy, to scams related to holy scars, to false academic announcements. The Jinki-ren then realized a very troublesome fact: they did not have the power to prove that these were lies. They did not have the power to prove them false, because they did not know what Honkai energy could do. When one reads the development of human history, it becomes clear that when confronted with things that are not understood, the best way to control them is through religion. So the Jinki-ren quickly reconstructed Schicksal and remade it into a legitimate social association in modern society. But all this is no longer in time. In the near future, what was just a power stone scam will turn into a giant lie called \"continental shelf oscillator. And ultimately a world war that was not necessary will be triggered.",

The story is about an archbishop named Otto who arrives in a world of swords and sorcery and uses cheats to defeat and attract a large number of women who pay tribute to him. The characters in the story have deviated considerably from the historical facts. What is particularly bad is that the illustrator's faces are almost identical, and the reader is told that they all look like Kallen. The story of a large number of tribute women lacks freshness as much as the same heroine just changes her clothes. Not only that, but even Otto, who is in charge of the illustrations, has a Kallen face. And even worse, the illustrator even draws each of the enemies with a Kallen face].",

	"737356": "[This book is a brief history of the development of Changku City. It describes the development of Changku City as a city and historical events from the A.D. period to the Legion of Honor]. After the death of General Dolores, the international situation changed drastically. Chang Ku City was no longer a restricted military zone, and many citizens returned to Chang Ku City to engage in production and construction. Considering the unique position of Chang Ku City at this time, the two sides that were about to enter the civil war in the Southern Legion, after discussions, agreed not to have any military conflicts in and around Chang Ku City. Thus, the governmental body of Changku City ceased to be the Changku Special Forces Command and was changed to the Changku City Government. Elections were then held, and Colonel Burns Lee, who had experience in city planning operations before the war, was elected mayor. The Three-headed Alliance valued Colonel Lee's background in the center, while the Southern Continental Alliance valued his old sacral lineage. The citizens of Changku City also greatly appreciated the fact that the colonel had been involved in the hyper-urbanization movement in his youth, and they looked to him to bring wealth and power to Changku City, which had been devastated by the civil war and the Cold Iron Rebellion.",
	"737357": "On December 7, 40 A.D., Mayor Lee took the oath of office before the Eternal Anchor and announced his first policy since taking office: the reurbanization of Changku City. Representatives from Honkai Academy joined in the celebration, and more than 40,000 flowers and 4,000 balloons flew through the air, drawing applause and cheers from all around. At that time, no one knew that only three years later, he would face a difficult end, as he would be condemned by many people and his merits and demerits would be difficult to discuss.",

	"737360": "[This book is a brief history of the development of Changku City. It describes the development of Changku City as a city and historical events from the Western Era to the Military Annals]. The Great Divide in the south continued, and every day people lost their homes and took refuge in the last refuge of Chang Ku City. However, as Mayor Lee continues to expand the refugee intake, the people of Chang Ku City begin to realize the conspiracy behind the reurbanization project: in three years, the urban area of Chang Ku City has grown several times in size, but the construction of the urban infrastructure has not kept pace, and there are large numbers of blind spots and substantial slums in the city that are under supervision and management. were occurring. The efforts were not for the welfare of the people of Changku City, but were only being carried out in the South in the context of an arrangement between the military and Herrscher. Colonel Lee continued to expand Changku City endlessly just to accommodate more refugees. Seeing the crime rate rising every month and a public transportation system where delays became the norm, citizens began to believe they had been duped and began to criticize Colonel Lee both in cyberspace and in the real world. And the Confederacy of the Southern Continent and the Triumvirate also realized that Burns Lee's commitment to certain principles would not completely sway either side, so they decided to replace the mayor.",
	"737361": "In the midst of all this, someone revealed the fact that Barnes Lee had posted the First Corps' most famous slogan, \"Give it all up for all mankind,\" on a social networking site when he was a young man. The postings were made before the civil war began, and at the time, the First Corps was a central institution in both name and reality, so it did not become an issue at the time. But now that he was in a position where people hated him, the post was considered unforgivable. Amid such invectives as \"Burns Lee is a remnant of the First Corps,\" and \"Burns Lee is pushing for deregulation of refugees to allow the First Corps to infiltrate Changchun City,\" Burns Lee resigned and his days as mayor came to an end. The fact that the civil war in the Southern Legion stopped shortly after he left also reinforced the impression that he was a plague. Burns Lee lost everything, the Confederation of the Southern Continent and the Triumvirate saw him as someone who was not loyal, and the citizens hated him because they thought he was using their blood money to make people from the outside feel good about themselves. He became increasingly impoverished and fell into decline, and died in a heavy rainstorm at the end of the year 43 A.D. of the Legion. On December 7, Legion A.D. 43, he may have been remembering the day he was sworn in as mayor three years earlier. That day, after drinking heavily, Colonel Lee boarded a bus to go to the poorhouse he had built, but was forced off the bus by the driver and citizens who realized he was a former mayor and had no choice but to walk to his destination. As he passed through a slum, he was robbed and beaten up by refugees, and all his money and goods were stolen. (According to subsequent statements, the refugees did not know he was Mayor Lee.)",
	"737362": "He was so exhausted and dizzy that he woke up, but it was pouring down and he slipped and fell into a ditch, where he drowned in the dirty water. If Burns Lee had focused on promoting investment and developing the economy of Changkuu City, which has the unique advantage of being a transfer city, the broken ditch would have been repaired instead of being left unattended, the streetlights would have worked without breaking, and he might not have had to die a miserable death. And if only he had not been so obsessed with the First Corps idea of equality, he might still be mayor then. Even the people of Changku City, who hated him, had to admit that Colonel Lee's education was outstanding. But such a parable was meaningless. The people of Changkuu soon forgot about him, and the only people who occasionally talked about him were the refugees, most of whom left Changkuu City and returned to their homes when the war was over. The new refugees who became citizens of Changkua also became integrated into society, and in order to fit in, they stopped talking about Burns Lee. They wanted different things, and Barnes Lee gave them. Burns Lee certainly lived up to the slogan he had stated when he was young, and he left this world. After his death, the long-empty city entered a new era, and I will leave the contents from there to be explained in the next volume. .......",

	"737365": "[This is a book for youth that introduces Honkai energy. On the cover is a two-headed character with a gun in each hand and a cross on his back. The character looks familiar, but it seems slightly different from the image in my head, and I was concerned about copyright issues. After the end of the Great Honkai War, some young historians began to study human history from a completely new perspective. This is the so-called Honkai school of history. The Honkai school of history believes that the causes, circumstances, and consequences of all major historical events in the past should take into account the intervention of disruptive energies, with emphasis on economic fundamentals, geopolitics, and climate. Many experts were highly alarmed by these ideas. At the time (2 BCE), the nature and effects of Honkai energy were not yet well understood, and experts believed that the abuse of Honkai energy could lead to the spread of historical nihilism and conspiracy theories. The controversy will not reach a convincing conclusion until humanity has a true grasp of Honkai energy. Meanwhile, many researchers in each of the large laboratories of the Jinki-ren pointed out that the study of Honkai energy has an alchemical aspect, and it was reported that some experiments cannot be conducted without a specific brand of drinking water on the computers in the lab. No one has been able to successfully explain the reasons for this situation.",
